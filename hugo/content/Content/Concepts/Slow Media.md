# Slow Media
A movement to slow the pace of information in modern times. With the advent of social media and the 24 hour news cycle, content is served *to* the user at increasingly rapid paces. This puts pressure both on information-givers and information-takers to be on top of a rapid firehose of information, often unfiltered.

## Tools that I think can help
- RSS feeds, to help filter what types of media show in our feeds
- Feedly, which shows a limited number of articles as "Today's" articles
- Social media which does not encourage likes/shares/etc - for example, blogging

## What is missing?
- Ways to access older, but more thoroughly researched, content. How do you make it more evergreen? Where can you go to find reliable, well-researched information?
	- [[What is the purpose of libraries?]]

## Connections I make
- **COVID-19:** I wonder about the connection between rapid media/information expectations and waning public support of Dr. Fauci's recommendations.
- **Journalistic errors:** I am interested in if there is a connection between an increase in erroneous reporting and the change in media consumption over time.
- **Mob mentalities:** I remember the Boston Marathon bombings, and when Reddit was quick to "solve" the mystery of the bomber by rapidly exchaning information - only to find they were completley wrong.
