**Chernoff faces**, invented by applied mathematician, statistician and physicist [Herman Chernoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Chernoff "Herman Chernoff")in 1973, display [multivariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics "Multivariate statistics") data in the shape of a human face. The individual parts, such as eyes, ears, mouth and nose represent values of the variables by their shape, size, placement and orientation. The idea behind using faces is that humans easily recognize faces and notice small changes without difficulty. Chernoff faces handle each variable differently. Because the features of the faces vary in perceived importance, the way in which variables are mapped to the features should be carefully chosen (e.g. eye size and [eyebrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyebrow "Eyebrow")-slant have been found to carry significant weight).
