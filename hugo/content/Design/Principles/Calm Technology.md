# Calm technology
A set of principles of interaction design that seeks to reduce user attention, focus, and other principles typically lauded and misused for addictive purposes. Calm technology is a direct response to the idea of "delight" having gone too far, and hopes to achieve an excellent user experience by creating a supportive environment, where the technology only interrupts or seeks attention as needed. It also hopes to solve the problem with the least technological interference possible.

Calm technology hopes to be aware of and correct for a number of factors outside of technology which could impact a user's experience negatively:

- Societal norms
- Environment
- Learned technological ability
- The stress induced by rapid change
- Existing environmental cues, "fading" technology into the background instead of bringing it to the front of the mind
