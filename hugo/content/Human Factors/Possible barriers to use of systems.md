# Possible barriers to use of systems
- Height (short/tall)
- Muscular ability/strength (pushing, pulling, flipping, tearing)
- Precision/control of motor skills (touch area, input precision)
- Cognitive load (number of items to remember, manage)
	- short term memory
	- Working memory
	- Long term memory
- executive function, mental illness, effort
- visual ability/acuity (color blindness, macular degeneration)
- Hearing ability
- Misunderstanding or mismatched mental models - perhaps due to culture, previous knowledge, socialization, literacy
	- mismatch in labeling in steps vs final action to take (start menu to shut down ch 1 above)
- inconsistency in systems of this type (VCRs all had different buttons, menus, see [[Chapter 1 -  Historical Foundations of Human Factors, Human Factors in Simple and Complex Systems, 3rd Edition]])
- multiple or invisible points of failure (chapter 1 above)
- Unclear directions
- icons without clear connection to meaning or distinguishing features (ch 1 above)

## Considerations
- Effects of long term/repetitive use, such as carpal tunnel w/ keyboards

## Developments 
-  one hand blender, remote controls, wider doors in trains
