### Biomechanics and physiology of human performance 
- Galileo and Newton
- Jules Amar 
	- initiated investigations into the application of biomechanical principles to work performance
- development of procedures that allowed a dynamic assessment of human performance
- **Eadweard Muybridge** -  banks of cameras that allowed him to take pictures of animals and humans in action
	- you know him from contributions to animation
	- captured the biomechanical characteristics of complex action

- Etienne-Jules Marey exploited related photographic techniques to decompose time and motion
- Modern camera-based systems, such as OPTOTRAK CERTUS® (see Figure 1.6), track small infrared sensors attached to a person’s body to analyze movement kinematics in three dimensions.
