This chapter inspired me to create [[Possible barriers to use of systems]]

## Introduction
- Every system has a purpose or goal.
	- Reminds me of [[The purpose of systems]]
- Ability of a system to meet its goals depends on humans involved
	- Reminds me of [[Chapter 3]] about design management 
	- if a small person cannot reach the light switch, or an elderly person is not strong enough to operate the switch, then the light will not go on and the goal of illumination will not be met
	- failure of either can lead to failure of the entire system

[[Computer technology]]
[[Healthcare systems]]
[[Cybersecurity]]
[[Serious accidents from major system failures]] 

## Historical antecedents
- impetus: technological developments during World War II
- technological advances were being made in factory automation and in equipment for common use, brought complex tech to users
- need for human factors analyses became evident
- preceded by research in the areas of human performance psychology, industrial engineering, and human physiology

[[Psychology of human performance]]
[[Human performance in applied settings]]
[[Biomechanics and physiology of human performance]]

## Emergence of human factors profession
- Begins in 1940s
- driven by tech advances in wwII
- Kenneth Craik - first director of the Applied Psychology Unit
- leader in the use of computers to model human information processing
- Paul M. Fitts (like Fitt's Law? Yes!) central figure in the development of human factors
- Bell Laboratories established a laboratory devoted specifically to human factors in the late 1940s

## Contemporary human factors
- From 1960 to 2000, the profession of human factors grew immensely
- membership of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society increased from a few hundred people to more than 4500 by the late 1980s

- Outside of computer science, the rapid growth of technology has made the human factors profession a key component in the development and design of equipment and machinery.
- close ties between human factors and the military have persisted since the years of World War II
- U.S. military incorporates human factors analyses into the design and evaluation of all military systems
-  All branches of the military have human factors research programs
- Human Systems Integration (HSI) initiative - provide equal consideration of the human along with the hardware and software in the technical and technical management processes for engineering a system that will optimize total system performance and minimize total ownership costs
- automotive industry has devoted considerable attention to human factors in the design of automobiles
- modern office furniture
- makers of automobiles, furniture, ball-point pens, and the like advertise their products in terms of the specific ergonomic advantages that their products have over those of their competitors
- factors contributing to a collision of the Russian supply spacecraft Progress 234 with the Mir space station in 1997 included poor visual displays and operator fatigue resulting from sleep deprivation
- space poses new constraints (Lewis, 1990). For example, in microgravity environments, a personâ€™s face will tend to become puffy.
- a person can be viewed from many more orientations (e.g., upside-down)
- perception of the nonlinguistic cues provided by facial expressions likely is impaired, compromising face-to-face communication
- NASA quickly acknowledged the need to incorporate human factors into the design of all aspects of the space station
- Issues of concern included, for example, design of user interfaces for the equipment used by the astronauts to conduct scientific experiments
- how to achieve effective performance of multicultural crews
- dynamics of crew tension during the mission and their influence on performance
- effects of psychological and physiological adaptation on crew performance in emergency situations

>  When design decisions are made, failure to consider human factors can lead to waste of personnel and money, injury and discomfort, and loss of life. Consequently, consideration of human factors concerns at all phases of system development is of utmost importance.
