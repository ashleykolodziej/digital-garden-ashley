### Electronic / digital equipment
- How well it works is often limited by human
	- reminds me of human error, misunderstanding
- Because there were many points in this process at which users could get confused and make mistakes, and different VCRs embedded different command options under various menus and submenus in the interface, even someone who was relatively adept at programming recorders had problems, especially when trying to operate a machine with which he was unfamiliar.
- Roku, others - in many cases, they must be connected to other devices (such as a television set or a home Internet router) to perform their functions (extra points of failure)
- Not just "old" people - "However, young adults who are more technologically sophisticated still have trouble with these kinds of devices"
-  Another published study asked college students to use a VCR. Even after training, 20% of them thought that the VCR was set correctly when in fact it was not (Gray, 2000).
