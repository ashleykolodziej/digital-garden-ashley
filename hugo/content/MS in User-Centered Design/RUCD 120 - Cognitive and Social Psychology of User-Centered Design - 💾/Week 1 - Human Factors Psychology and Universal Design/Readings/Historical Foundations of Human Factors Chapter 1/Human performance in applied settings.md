### Human performance in applied settings
#### Job specialization and productivity
- **Charles W. Babbage** - proposed methods for increasing the efficiency with which workers could perform their jobs
	- Advocated for job specialization, based on idea of factory line
	- Worked on development of computers to reduce errors in calculations
-  **W. B. Jastrzębowski** - first to use term ergonomics 
	- distinguished useful work, which helps people, from harmful work, which hurts people
	- emphasized the development of useful work practices
- **Frederick W. Taylor** - one of the first people to systematically investigate human performance in applied settings
	- examined worker productivity in industrial settings
	- conducted one of the earliest human factors studies
	- made three contributions to the enhancement of productivity in the workplace:
		- task analysis
			- time-and-motion study:  worker’s movements analyzed across time to determine the best way to perform a task
		- concept of pay for performance
		- personnel selection, or fitting the worker to the task
		- now viewed as being dehumanizing and exploitative, but increased productivity 
- **Frank Bunker Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth**
	- applied systematic analysis to human work
	- developed an influential technique for breaking motions into fundamental elements during work
	- analyzed # of movements a worker made by things like tool placement, raw materials, structure
	- analysis of operating-room procedures led to the development of contemporary surgical protocols
	- Extended motion analysis to the performance of household tasks and designs for people with disabilities
- **Hugo Münsterberg**
	- examined work efficiency, personnel selection, and marketing techniques
- many focuses on personnel selection but...

>  While personnel selection can increase the quality of system performance, there are limits to how much performance can be improved through selection alone. A poorly designed system will not perform well even if the best personnel are selected.
