### Psychology of human performance
- Study of basic human capabilities involved in perceiving and acting on information arriving through the senses
- dates to the mid-19th century (Boring, 1942)
- sensory psychophysics and the time to perform various mental operations

#### Sensory psychophysics 
- Ernst Weber and Gustav Fechner
- investigated the sensory and perceptual capabilities of humans
-  **Weber’s law** - people's ability to detect that two stimuli (inputs) differ in magnitude
	- the *absolute* amount of change needed to perceive a difference in magnitude increases with intensity, whereas the *relative* amount remains constant
	- example: the heavier a weight is, the greater the absolute increase must be to perceive another weight as heavier

	- The more stuff you are dealing with, the bigger the **amount** of stuff that is different needs to be for a person to notice the difference. That's because that minimum difference is a ratio
- **Fechner** (1860/1966) formalized the methods that Weber used and constructed the first scales for relating psychological magnitude (e.g., loudness) to physical magnitude (e.g., amplitude).
	- the subjective sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity

	- **According to this law, our perceptual experience of stimulus intensity (e.g., the loudness of a sound we perceive) increases _much less quickly_ than the actual real world physical stimulus (e.g., the sound waves themselves, measured in decibels) increases…** source https://nwnoggin.org/resources/class-resources/
	- Reminds me of why it's hard to understand large numbers

#### Speed of mental processing
- **Hermann von Helmholtz** - established a method for estimating the time for the transmission of a nerve impulse
- speed of transmission from stimulating frog's nerve to muscle contraction was approximately 27 m/s
- important because it demonstrates that neural transmission is **not instantaneous and takes measurable time**
- Franciscus C. Donders - developed procedures called chronometric methods
	- thought if a person performs a timed task, they must make a series of judgments
		- detect a stimulus (is something there?) and then identify it (what is it?)
		- may need to discriminate that stimulus from other stimuli (which one is it?)
		- selects the appropriate response to the stimulus (what response am I to make?)
	- **subtractive logic** - designed some simple tasks that differed in the combination of judgments, estimated the time it took to make the judgments by subtracting different results from each other
	- provided the foundation for the notion that mental processes can be isolated

#### Wundt and attention
-  **Wilhelm Wundt** - first laboratory devoted exclusively to psychological research
	- advocated the view that mental events play a causal role in human behavior
	- our mental representation of the world is a function of experience and the way our mind organizes that experience
	- used a wide range of psychophysical and chronometric methods to investigate attentional processes
- **William James** - notable for views on attention

> Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seems several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others. (James, 1890/1950, pp. 403–404)

- captures many of the properties of attention: 
	- different types of attention
	- limitations in processing capacity
	- role of consciousness

#### Learning and skill acquisition 
- **Hermann Ebbinghaus** - first to apply experimental rigor successfully to the study of learning and memory
- up until this time, people thought this was impossible to study
- series of experiments conducted on himself examined his ability to learn and retain lists of nonsense syllables
- provided the basis for a scientific investigation of higher mental function
- **Bryan and Harter** extended the topic of learning and memory to the investigation of skill acquisition
- determined many of the factors involved in the acquisition of perceptual-motor skills
- By examining learning curves (plots of performance as a function of amount of practice), proposed that learning proceeds in a series of phases
- Reminds me of teaching
