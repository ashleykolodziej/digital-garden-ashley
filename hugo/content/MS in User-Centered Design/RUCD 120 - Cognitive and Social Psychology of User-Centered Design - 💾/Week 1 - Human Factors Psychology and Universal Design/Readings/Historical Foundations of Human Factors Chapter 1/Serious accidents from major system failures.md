### Serious accidents from major system failures
- challenger space shuttle explosion
	- Design flaws, relaxed safety regulations, sequence of bad decisions
	- Administration, culture problems within NASA
	- almost exactly the same kinds of mistakes and errors of judgment contributed to the deaths of seven astronauts on February 1, 2003, when the space shuttle Columbia broke up
		- cameras monitoring the launch clearly recorded foam break off, quick decision was made by NASA officials that it did not threaten the safety of the shuttle
		- engineers had worried for many years about foam strikes
		- requested (several times) that Space Shuttle Program managers coordinate to obtain images of the Columbia with military satellites to determine extent of damage
		- Ignored even after engineers modeled simulations showing heat shield damage
		- Result of groupthink among managers
- malfunction of a pressure valve triggered core meltdown at Three Mile Island nuclear power plant 
	- emergency equipment functioned properly
	- poorly designed warning displays and control panels escalated situation 
	- incident resulted in considerable “bad press” for the nuclear power industry as well as financial loss
	- attitudes toward nuclear power: Popular support for this alternative energy source dropped precipitously and has remained low ever since
	- major impetus for the establishment of formal standards in nuclear plant design
- Swedish car and passenger ferry, sank off the coast of Finland because the bow doors broke open and allowed water to pour into the hold
- door locks failed because of poor design and lack of maintenance
- increased attention to ergonomic issues on ferries did not prevent other disasters from occurring
	- crew was poorly trained, and few safety procedures existed
- engineer failed to respond appropriately to a red signal in train collision because he was "engaged in text messaging at the time.”
- goal: have a good understanding of how the errors that led to these incidents occurred and of steps that can be taken in the design and evaluation of systems to minimize the likelihood of their occurrence
