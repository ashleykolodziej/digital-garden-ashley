## What is human factors and ergonomics?
- Humans and machine both part of same system, so makes sense to measure performance of humans and machines consistently, with same terminology, etc 
	- ex: reliability (the probability of successful performance) of human components can be evaluated in the same way as the reliability of machine components
- **human factors (ergonomics):** study of variables which influence how efficiently a human interacts with elements of a system to achieve goals
	- Other names include human engineering, engineering psychology, and, most recently, human–systems integration

> Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the
understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and
the profession that applies theory, principles, data, and other methods to design in
order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.

- human factors specialists research all phases of system development and evaluation
- importance of basic human capabilities, such as perceptual abilities, attention span, memory span, and physical limitations
	- example: light switch placement height requires knowledge of the anthropometric constraints (i.e., the physical characteristics) of the population of intended users
	- Not just an average - consider wheelchairs
- consider people’s perceptual, cognitive, and movement capabilities when designing information displays and controls
- Knowledge of human beings includes capabilities and limitations, behavioral and cultural stereotypes, anthropometric and biomechanical attributes, motor control, perception and sensation, cognitive abilities, and, most recently, emotional attributes addressed by affective human factors.

> Only designs that accommodate and optimize the capabilities of the system’s users will be able to maximize total system performance. Otherwise, the system performance will be reduced, and the system goals may not be met.


### Basic human performance 
- human performance analyzes processes that underlie acquisition, maintenance, transfer, and execution of skilled behavior
	- identifies factors which limit performance
	- breaks complex tasks into easier to analyze simple tasks
	- estimates of basic human capabilities
	- Can predict how well people will be able to perform both simple and complex tasks
- human performance researcher: identifies and breaks task into steps, researches limitations 
	- Before the light can be turned on, the human must perceive a need for light, decide on the appropriate action, and execute the action necessary to flip the switch
- human factors specialist: designs system for optimal use
	- designs light switch, chooses placement on wall
- **you have more freedom designing a process or system than you do in changing human behavior **

>  we can redesign and improve the machine components, but we shouldn’t expect to be able to (or be permitted to) redesign and improve the operator

- can train, but some limitations can't be "trained out"

### Human-machine systems and domains of specialization

- the entire human–machine system is embedded within the larger context of the work environment
- influence can be measured for the machine component or the human component as well as the interface
- **macroergonomics**: the interactions between the organizational environment and the design and implementation of a system
- total system performance - environment, operator, and machine
- In solving a particular problem involving human–machine interaction, the human factors specialist usually starts with a consideration of the capabilities of the operator **because that's your main limitation**

### Human-Computer Interaction
- an interdisciplinary field of study devoted to facilitating user interactions with computers
- Although some HCI experts regard it as a distinct field, it can be treated as a subfield of human factors  because it represents the application of human factors principles and methods to the design of computer interfaces
- issues include everything from the properties of displays and data-entry devices
- presentation of complex information in a way that minimizes mental workload and maximizes comprehension
	- reminds me of [[information architecture]], [[Week 2 - Cognitive Science in Data Visualization]]
- development of smart environments—offices, homes, businesses, classrooms, vehicles—in which adjustments and communications are made in response to input from sensors in the environment, people’s preferences, and their actions
- physical design might address carpal tunnel system prevention
- Cognitive design might include icons to help working memory
