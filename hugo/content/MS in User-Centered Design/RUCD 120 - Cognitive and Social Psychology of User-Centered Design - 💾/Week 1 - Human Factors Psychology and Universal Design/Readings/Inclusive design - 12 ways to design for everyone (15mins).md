- Inclusive design considers as many people‚Äôs needs and abilities as possible. 
- goes further than accessibility (permanent disability)
- there are temporary, situational, or changing disabilities that affect us all
	- noisy environments
	- screen glare in sunlight
	- tap links on touch screens that are positioned too close to each other

> The central premise behind creating shared value is that the competitiveness of a company and the health of the communities around it are mutually dependent. It then becomes good business to do good.

## 1. Get to know the people you design for
- broaden the groups you test with
- the teams you work with
- those that advise you
- those that are part of your social circles
- Design isn‚Äôt just a moment, it‚Äôs the thoughts we take in and the actions we put out daily
- Microsoft‚Äôs Inclusive Design Tookit argues that there‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äònormal‚Äô and that we can‚Äôt assume all senses and abilities are fully enabled all the time.

## 2. Remember that every single customer benefits

> Now we look at a small sheet of glass on a sunny day, we juggle our phones one-handed, we‚Äôre distracted or in a rush. We are, quite literally, temporarily vision, motor, hearing, and cognitively impaired on a daily basis.

## 3. Identify your assumptions
- when we don‚Äôt take stock of our assumptions are and how they might impact others, we can leave people out and not even realize it
- Questioning assumptions means taking what you think is true about your users and then asking, what if the opposite is true?

## 4. Remember that inclusive design should be a part of every stage of product development
- inclusive design needs to be considered at every stage
- At the design stage consider things like documenting expected keyboard interaction and reading order, color contrast, and text and media accessibility
- If you do an amazing job documenting keyboard accessibility but a developer never sees it or it was implemented incorrectly, your work ends up having little value for your end users

## 5. Don‚Äôt let the data take over
- Data isn‚Äôt a be-all end-all
- remember that data is only as good as those collecting it and asking questions of it
- Diverse teams, built with inclusive hiring practices, are imperative
- Numbers are only as neutral as the people using them

## 6. Design for uncommon uses first
- designing a beautiful interface that works pleasurably with a keyboard first, and then add the more common interactions as an afterthought
- make sure that the hierarchy is completely clear for a screen reader first
- only then start adding visual hierarchy

## 7. Be considerate when using color
- phone is used in direct sunlight
- user with a poorly set up display
- perceive color differently due to color blindness
- Use good contrast. A ratio of 4:1 is a good starting point
- Good contrast is a foundation of good color design
- Avoid relying on color for meaning
- underlining links
- adding textures to charts and graphics

## 8. Design with clear affordances
- indicators of what can be done within a web page or site
- a search box indicates to the user that the site has a search
- a button indicates that something is clickable
- make sure that interactive elements look interactive
- avoid going too flat with buttons and elements
- especially helpful for cognitively impaired users, distracted users, or users in a hurry

> ‚ÄúAs a general rule of thumb, one thing on a page can be obvious. Three things can be easy, and everything else is possible.‚Äù

## 9. Design inclusive user interfaces
- Can you open and close the modal dialog via the keyboard?
- Is it possible to interact with the content behind the modal?
- Are people using assistive technologies like screen readers informed about the opening modal?

- Do not design text in images 
- Crucial product design and development decisions should only be made by those who have a personal investment or connection to the product problem
- Tie inclusive design into strategic objectives
