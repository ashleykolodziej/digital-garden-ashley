## **Readability**

determined by factors such as 
- word length
- word commonality
- sentence length
- number of clauses in a sentence
- and number of syllables in a sentence
- common (false) belief that complex information requires complex presentation
- complex information requires the **simplest presentation possible**, so that the focus is on the information rather than the way it is presented.

## For enhanced readability:
- omit needless words and punctuation
- Do not sacrifice meaning or clarity 
- Avoid acronyms, jargon, and untranslated quotations in foreign languages
- Keep sentence length appropriate for the intended audience
- use active voice, 
- consider passive voice when the emphasis is on the message and not the messenger
- When attempting to produce text for a specific reading level, use published readability formulas and software applications designed for this purpose
- do not write for the formulas - use as guideline
- more sentences per paragraph may increase readability for lower-level readers, but frustrate readability for more advanced readers who are distracted by the lack of continuity.
- Simple language is preferred, but do not obscure meaning

## Using Edward Fryâ€™s Readability Graph

1. Randomly select three sample passages from a text.
2. Count 100 words starting at the beginning of these passages (count proper nouns, but not numbers).
3. Count the number of sentences in each 100-word passage, estimating the length of the last sentence to the nearest 1/10th.
4. Count the total number of syllables in each 100-word passage.
5. Calculate the average number of sentences and average number of syllables for the 100-word passage. If a great deal of variability is found, sample additional passages.
6. The area of intersection on the graph between the number of sentences and average number of syllables indicate the estimated grade level. Invalid regions indicate that a reading level could not be estimated.
