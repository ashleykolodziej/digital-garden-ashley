## Abstract 

Design for all, universal access and inclusive design are all different names of approaches that largely focus on increasing the accessi- bility of the interactive system for the widest possible range of use

investigating the various concepts used for accessibility

It can be concluded that there is little or no consensus regarding the definition and use of the concept, and con- sequently, there is a risk of bringing less accessibility to the target audience.

international standardiza- tion the lack of consensus is striking

## Introduction

no consensus on formulating the concept of accessibility in different areas, not even within the ISO standardization community

interpreted differently depending on the design approach used for the development

### Economic benefits

increased income for someone who otherwise would not be able to work, had it not been for an adequate level of accessibility at the workplace

companies offering products or services developed to meet the highest levels of accessibility may find an opportunity to offer this product to an even broader market

also see new forms of use of their produc

having a larger percentage of the population work

corresponding decrease in people being dependent on social security

positive impact on social sustainability and promote quality of life for the target audience

â€˜What is essential for some specific users for them to be able to use a product, often makes it more efficient to use for most people

60 % of the adult workforce is likely or very likely to benefit from the use of accessible technology

when a commercial website was re-launched in a new version taking accessibility issues into consideration by applying WCAG 1.0, not only was it easier to use for individuals with disabilities, but also, as a side effect, the maintenance costs were reduced by 66 % and the load time of the page was reduced by 75 %. There was also a 30 % increase in the natural search engine traffic

## 2 Purpose and justification

United Nations, the European Commission, USA, Japan, China and many more. In many countries, non-discrimination laws that require a certain level of accessibility are actually in place.

major challenge, however, is that the term accessi- bility is used in so many different contexts where it may mean different things

use the term accessibility without thoroughly defining it 

use other concepts to cover more or less the same area

Different schools of thought may take the term accessibility to have a slightly different meaning 

a clearer definition will promote awareness, facilitate discussion, enable implementation and promote the development of better methods for increasing accessibility.

## 3 Approaches and design thinking

and as the population gets older, the number of people with functional difficulties is consequently also growing

meeting these needs has become an important goal on the political agenda 

growing recognition of the needs of better integrating elderly people and people with disabilities in society

attracted the interest of developers and designers to enable them to obtain an increased independence in terms of societal help and sup- port for performing everyday tasks 

### 3.1 Barrier-free design

1950s

people returning to the US with injuries after the Vietnam War

national standards for â€˜â€˜barrier-freeâ€™â€™ buildings

making buildings accessible by handicapped soldiers and others with similar conditions

offer education and employment opportunities, as an alternative to institutionalized health care

remendous develop- ment of assistive technologies with the purpose of increasing disabled individualsâ€™ possibility to participate in everyday life

building and home equipment

one hand blender, remote controls, and wider doors in trains.

### 3.2 Design for all

products are designed for an all-encompassing customer base and that a product is made to be usable by the widest possible range of people.

This does not, however, automatically imply that there is such a thing as a single solution that suits all [7].

â€˜design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality 

We now survive illness and injury and live with disability as never before

base our designs on the principle of inclusion

aims to enable all people to have equal opportunities to participate in every aspect of society 

verything that is designed and made by people to be used by people â€“ must be accessible, convenient for everyone in society to use and responsive to evolving human diversity

makes conscious use of the analysis of human needs and aspirations

requires the involvement of end users at every stage in the design process.

sustainability is defined as a composite concept entailing cultural as well as ecological, economical and social aspects.

demonstrably suitable for most of the potential users without any modifications

products which are easily adaptable to different users

incorporating adaptable or customisable user interfaces

products which have standardized interfaces, capable of being accessed by specialized user interac- tion devices

no one should be excluded because of their disabilities or functional difficul- ties. 

contextualizes this goal as part of a broad vision of developing a sustainable society

### 3.3 Universal design

concept of designing products and environments for the needs of people, regardless of their age, ability or status in life 

has its roots in the Barrier-free design and accessible design approaches

term Universal design can be used interchangeable with the term design for all

what can be barrier free for one person can be a barrier for someone else

The universal design definition is â€˜â€˜The design of pro- ducts and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized designâ€™â€™ 

seven principles 

Equitable Use The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. â€¢ Flexibility in Use The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. â€¢ Simple and Intuitive Use Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the userâ€™s experience, knowledge, language skills or current concentration level. â€¢ Perceptible Information The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the userâ€™s sensory abilities. â€¢ Tolerance for Error The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. â€¢ Low Physical Effort The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. â€¢ Size and Space for Approach and Use Appropriate size and space are provided for approach, reach, manipula- tion and use regardless of the userâ€™s body size, posture or mobility.

Toyota that has applied the concept of universal design, to make their cars ready for adaptation already from the start. If the buyer would like to make some changes in the driving environment, such as changing the accelerator from using it with the foot to using it with the hand, a standard gizmo can be bought and easily installed. 

most of the controls in the car replaceable

### 3.4 Inclusive design

Inclusive design bears similarities to universal design and design for all, but with the requirement to also include the concept of â€˜â€˜reasonableâ€™â€™ in the definition

The design of mainstream products and/or services that are accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible on a global basis, in a wide variety of situations and to the greatest extent possi- ble without the need for special adaptation or spe- cialized design. [14].

â€˜reason- ablyâ€™â€™ seems to suggest that the inclusion of people with disabilities can be disregarded if considered too difficult to achieve or too costly

â€˜inclu- sive designâ€™â€™ is not a fixed set of design criteria, but a constantly evolving philosophy

### 3.5 User-sensitive inclusive design/design for dynamic diversity

claim that the goals argued for in these approaches are not realistic goals for all products and could actually even be counterproductive.

If UCD is to be used in a situation where people with disabilities are included in the user group, this must mean changes in the methodology

wide variety of functionality and characteristics of user groups

makes it very hard to get a small representative sample 

also to design products that are accessible for all potential users

â€˜â€˜inclusiveâ€™â€™ indicates an attempt for a more realistic view on which groups can be included in the user group 

Elderly people are in a process of reduction in their cognitive, physical and sen- sory functions in an individualized way, which means that when designing for this group, the designers have to take the dynamic diversity into account [16].

### 3.6 Accessible design

extending standard design to persons with some type of performance limitation to maximize the number of potential customers

designing products, services and environments that are readily usable by most users without any modification, â€¢ making products or services adaptable to different users (adapting user interfaces) and â€¢ having standardized interfaces to be compatible with special products for persons with disabilities

â€˜is not limited to the 5th to 95th percentiles of working populations

derived from the ADA (American Disability Act) standard for accessible design,

### 3.7 Universal access

broader perspective of the possibilities for everyone to use the product or ser- vice even with assistive technologies, if necessary

strong position in the area of design in Asia, especially in Japan

within the tradition of universal access, accessibility does not concern people with physical or cognitive dis- abilities only, but is an aspect of increasing importance for society at large [20].

### 3.8 Cooperative design

Scandinavian culture

collaboration and participation on equal terms are inherent characteristics

when it comes to the involvement of users with special requirements, such an approach may be very fruitful and give completely new insights into the process, thus contributing to increased accessibility

par- ticipatory design 

full cooperation between the users and the development team, who share their respective knowledge and experiences by designing together

using a democratic approach as a facilitatorâ€”

further development of this method was to addition- ally involve users with some form of disability in the Co- operative Design workshop resulting in short video proto- types of the solutions, offering valuable information to be used in the process of further developing a produc

accessibility issues were automatically included within the method by inviting participants from the widest range possible from all stakeholders in the area 

### 3.9 Summarizing approaches and design thinking

the terms â€˜â€˜design for allâ€™â€™, â€˜â€˜integral accessibilityâ€™â€™, â€˜â€˜accessible designâ€™â€™, â€˜â€˜inclusive designâ€™â€™, â€˜â€˜barrier-free designâ€™â€™, â€˜â€˜trans- generational designâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜accessibility for allâ€™â€™ are regar- ded as converging towards the term â€˜â€˜universal designâ€™â€™ 

all take the needs of a broader spectrum of people into account in the design process to ensure that mainstream equipment and services can be used by a wide range of users, including older people and those with disabilities

## 7.1 Consequences of â€¦

### 7.1.1 No definition

If there is no definition at all, there will be major diffi- culties in several areas

difficult for consumers to know whether or not a product meets their needs

considerably higher development costs due to the research needed in every design process in order to establish and meet the needs of undefined edge user groups

since accessibility would have to be defined in each particular product development, it would bring an active accessibility analysis into the very core of each design process.

lack of definition makes it difficult to set legal boundaries 

from an individual perspective, as well as from a company perspective, it becomes equally difficult to decide when sufficient accessibility has been reached in the eyes of the law.

How are we to guarantee every citizenâ€™s right to participate in societal activities and exercise influence over the governing structures of our society without some sort of agreed upon understanding of what access to these fundamental civic rights means?

### 7.1.2 Many definitions

could lead to difficulties for individuals to know whether or not a product meets their needs

make it difficult to compare products

risk of misunderstanding would be high

possibility for a particular individual to choose the definition or definitions most suitable for him/her

manufacturer and designer

decide which definition or definitions to be used in a spe- cific development process

juridical perspective, determining which defini- tion is applicable in a specific situation would pose a considerable challenge

### 7.1.3 A single definition

make it easier for consumers to set demands on products or ser- vices

risk that the definition would be too wide to be effective.

accessibility defined in terms of identity would mean disregarding the pluralistic consequences of accessibility being context dependent

it is necessary to be aware of the perspective from which accessibility is defined and the potential role the definition will play in relation to structural power

all definitions run the risk of being used as tools for constituting and maintaining structural power

## 7.2 Measurability

any model trying to capture and measure the dynamic aspects of accessibility 

needs to be formulated in a way that avoids too strong a focus on identity, essence and human characteristics 

focuses on 

the difference between user intention and outcome 

construct an accessibility measurement that can take into account the dynamic aspects of accessibility as a fully context-depen- dent endeavour

descriptions of physical characteristics and technical specifications, but also anal- yses of intentions, desires and habitus

draw on a broad variety of scientific disciplines

echnological and medical perspective 

social science 

humanities 

ISO 20282-3 standard 

key diffi- culties 

to select appropriate test panel participants that are representative of the user group for that specific product

instead

use stratified user groups that are most sensitive in certain area of the use of the product

a dynamic value rather than a static value is preferable

there has to be a limit value to start from as a lowest acceptable level

it is crucial to have easily determinable values that make it possible to apply them in the procurement process and to make the producers compete with these values.

two ways of conforming the accessi- bility demands

show the accessibility level 

use a design standardization process such as ISO 9241-210, 

## 7.3 Proposing a definition of accessibility

focus on the flexible, ever- changing gaps between a personâ€™s ability and a potential activity in a changing environment

All persons have dif- ferent abilities and disabilities, making it impossible to decide who is and who is not disabled

abilities and disabilities change over time and in different contexts

accessibility problems occur at the constantly changing intersection between the product, the context and the user.

a new, widened accessibility definition is suggested, that defines accessibility as â€˜â€˜the extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities are able to be used by a population with the widest range of characteristics and capabilities (e.g. physical, cognitive, financial, social and cultural, etc.), to achieve a specified goal in a specified context.â€™â€™

## 8 Conclusions

Different approaches to accessibility serve slightly differ- ent purposes, though they all share the same overall goal: To provide as effective and usable opportunities as possible for all potential system users, regardless of the challenges, the users may face.

wide variety of different concepts do lead to con- fusion, political struggles and lack of clarity about what is required to achieve these goals
