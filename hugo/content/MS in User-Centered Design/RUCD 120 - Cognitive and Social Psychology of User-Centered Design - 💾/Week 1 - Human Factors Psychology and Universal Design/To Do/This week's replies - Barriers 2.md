# Response to barrier - Fire Door

**Original Barrier:** A person who has difficulty using force may not use this exit at a similar speed.

To address the physical barrier of force required to open fire doors, I would recommend installing a large, pressure-sensitive floor panel, to be activated only during fires, which will open the fire door automatically when it detects pressure.

**Initial considerations unrelated to the original barrier**
- The icon on the signage suggests this door may require stairs. I would want to understand if exiting from this door actually requires using stairs or the environment poses any other accessibility problems beyond the door itself. 
- If stairs are not required and no barriers in the environment beyond the door are present, in addition to addressing the barrier, the signage should be redesigned to make this clearer. 
- If there are barriers beyond the door which cannot be removed, signage should be installed to clearly indicate the nearest accessible exit.
- I would still implement the suggested design change even if the exit is not wheelchair-accessible (see Unintended Benefits).

**Process and alternate ideas**
- In researching fire doors, I found that OSHA guidelines specify that "Openings must be protected by a self-closing, approved fire door that remains closed or automatically closes in an emergency" (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2018). This is to help slow a fire's spread by compartamentalizing the building and starving the fire of oxygen (_Why Fire Doors Are Labelled “Keep Shut,”_ n.d.). This ruled out an initial idea I had to open the doors automatically when fire alarms are triggered.
- The same heavy smoke that could interfere with someone seeing the fire door would also interfere with a typical mounted door sensor in a fire (_OPTEX Automatic Door Sensors FAQ_, n.d.).
- This led me to the idea of a large, pressure-sensitive panel in the floor near the door. Walking or rolling along this panel would trigger a door opening, similar to an automatic door.

**Possible unintended consequences**
- A pressure-sensitive floor panel may open the door accidentally or unintentionally if the area is high-traffic in normal situations, and the door is not set back. However, in the situation of a fire with heavy smoke, this could be a benefit as you would not need to know the exact location of the door to open it.
- I am unsure what possible technologies are available in pressure sensitivity and door opening, and whether they would continue working in an active fire. For example, firefighters may need to cut power to the building during a fire.
- A falling beam or other structural damage during a fire could fall on the panel and hold the doors open, making it easier for fire to spread.

**Unintended benefits**
- Because smoke rises, people are commonly advised to stay low or crawl in a fire to avoid smoke inhalation (_Smoke Facts and Safety Tips_, n.d.). In a low-visibility situation, the presence of a pressure-sensitive panel would allow someone who is crawling to stay in that low position until the door opens, reducing smoke inhalation.

**Confidence**
I have high confidence in the theoretical design solution of adding a pressure-sensitive panel in front of fire doors to facilitate automatic opening, as any accidental triggering of the panel is likely to be a desired behavior in an active fire where the primary goal is to get out. In some regards, I prefer this to the original solution of a touch panel on the door, because the "target area" to get the door open is much larger, and also more likely to be triggered by natural movement. Those same characteristics could compromise fire safety measures by keeping the doors open when structural damage happens.

I am also unsure if, given the available technology, this design would continue working through an active fire. I would prefer to have a better understanding of the environment around and outside these doors, and to understand if it is possible to limit the pressure sensitive panel activation only to active fire situations without compromising the safety of the design, before implementing it.
