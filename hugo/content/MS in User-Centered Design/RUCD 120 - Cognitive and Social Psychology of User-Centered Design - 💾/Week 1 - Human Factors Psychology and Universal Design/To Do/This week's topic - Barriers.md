# Barriers
**Context:**  
In one of your readings this week, Steinfeld, Maisel, & Levine propose a "new, widened accessibility definition:"  

“the extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities are able to be used by a population with the widest range of characteristics and capabilities (e.g. physical, cognitive, financial, social and cultural, etc.), to achieve a specified goal in a specified context.”

**Initial Post**: 

For this week's discussion, analyze the [designs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-6DTyGKDMKcC0ACPHYVzBKYnzK-gIk8Auf76gsXPbLg/edit?usp=sharing) assigned to you **You're set 1!** in terms of usability and accessibility. 
- Identify at least 2 potential barriers posed by each design. 
- Describe why they are barriers and to whom, and whether or not that barrier represents an accessibility problem.  
- Consider that not all barriers are bad - sometimes barriers are intentional, and not a problem unless poorly designed (e.g. safety or security features).

Include images of the designs you are reviewing as part of your post.

## Draft
In considering the definition of accessibility here, and that "accessibility problems occur at
the constantly changing intersection between the product, the context and the user," (Persson et al., 2015, p. 524), I can see I need at to identify at least two other pieces of information to understand if the barriers I can identify are accessibility problems: a goal, and a context. So for this assessment, I will provide goals based on my personal knowledge or educated guess, and support my contextual assessment with sources where possible.

### #1-S1 Traffic Light & Pedestrian Signal

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hgZ_jldJ5Cxl0HfhybGMftdUCBxISu2QDpO_x-U8LSXPukAL6azPYwCEJVYTgaMPbYPcLQSRDIrCdI-iLNWDD6eXXmZ4jszdKR2eTlTbxfG1t-DBa1jTAeajzBK9rkn45yzFXDJsl5XI)

Goals:
The traffic light and pedestrian signal have two goals that work in tandem.
- The goal of a traffic light is to safely and efficiently direct a vehicle through an intersection without hitting anything.
- The goal of a pedestrian signal is to safely and efficiently direct a non-vehicle, such as a person and a pet, through an intersection without being hit by a vehicle.

Context:
- In addition to typical vehicles, this intersection handles a train, and may handle high-speed traffic, judging by the sign providing directions to a freeway.
- We cannot assume the "typical" speed of a pedestrian. For example, someone with a broken leg may move more slowly on crutches. A jogger will move more quickly.
- Several types of pedestrian and driver behavior are attributed to decreased safety, such as inaccurate perception of risk, jaywalking, ignoring intersection signals, or distraction (_Pedestrian Injuries & Fatalities_, 2007). The presence of a train may cause increased impatience and distraction due to long wait times and loud noises, and it is extremely difficult to judge the speed of a train visually.

Barriers and accessibility conclusions
- Lack of timing information on the pedestrian walk signal is one barrier in this situation. Without an understanding of how much time to cross remains, it is difficult to accurately assess the risk of not crossing in time. This barrier affects everyone who uses the crosswalk, but would more greatly affect someone with temporary or permanent mobility issues, as they would likely need more time to cross the intersection. This could also intersect with cognitive impairment as it involves a judgement call, making someone who is also distracted by a phone or who struggles with decision-making and judgement at even higher risk. Because this violates the goal of moving all pedestrians safely across the crosswalk, and favors those with the presence of certain characteristics over others, I would consider this an accessibility problem.
- Another barrier is a lack of indication to drivers when a person is crossing in real time. In many U.S. intersections, lights are timed so that a green and a walk sign happen at the same time, which relies on the driver to check if anyone is in the crosswalk and yield to the pedestrian. Given the road signs, this type of intersection may accommodate semi trucks regularly. The drivers of these trucks likely have driven long distances which could impair their judgement, and will be seated higher up than the driver of the average vehicle, changing their angle of vision. It's plausible that because of that change in angle of vision, depending on the distance from the truck to the crosswalk, someone short enough - say, a child, or wheelchair user - could be at a higher risk for being hit by the driver by being in the truck's blind spot. Because this barrier violates the goals of both the traffic light and the pedestrian signal based on the physical characteristics of the pedestrian, I would consider this an accessibility problem.

### #2-S1 Gas Station Pump ([Left](https://keep.google.com/u/0/media/v2/1Ii8zmyqFqT8FMzhOhsruI07wFsGPorN14Cmh9S_texT7Vvhy0Y9jSR4s05J8hg/1X-9IiDvOsFHZzgVsX1WLwx80lpI08goLpeCxRFSbMzBs5TiA2VMznIFE3k088w?sz=512&accept=image%2Fgif%2Cimage%2Fjpeg%2Cimage%2Fjpg%2Cimage%2Fpng%2Cimage%2Fwebp) and [Right](https://keep.google.com/u/0/media/v2/1Kvv2lHAQsYNXL2dMoSzc8aJ0ubR3RGzlvODq2OKiWgt-7Qq9n8AOCDDF6wwI/1mpXnY6myAte7GYtWbmIGSsA77E9uWRZyc7fECxgljD-eaoo9wwXcQO58cFog?sz=512&accept=image%2Fgif%2Cimage%2Fjpeg%2Cimage%2Fjpg%2Cimage%2Fpng%2Cimage%2Fwebp))
Goals:
- To dispense gas for drivers.
- To create a positive experience with the Shell brand while pumping gas.

Context:
- I can see from this picture customer service must be important to this business, since someone went through the trouble to put "Welcome" on the screen. This, in combination with the savings offers and significant branding on the pump itself, imply a secondary goal of this pump is to create a positive experience with the Shell brand.
- After I did some brainstorming, I realized that I couldn't imagine how a wheelchair user could use this pump, because all the cars I have driven have the gas door on the driver side, which would not leave enough room to get out, turn around, and still have the nozzle and hose be long enough to reach the gas tank. To better understand this, I found a video of a person using a gas station pump in a wheelchair. In the beginning of the video, she describes her experience with a car like the one I imagined, and confirms that it was impossible for her to pump gas in this situation (_How to Go to the Gas Station as a Wheelchair User_, n.d.).

Barriers and accessibility conclusions

A possible barrier I indentified was in the alternate user interface with the "see screen above" prompt, where the controls for the interface are separated from the labels, which show on the screen. The "see screen above" requires a driver in a wheelchair to look upwards to see the screen and understand what each button available in the alternate interface matches to. Depending on the position of the wheelchair, I hypothesized this may be awkward or uncomfortable, and that the labels may not be possible to read from the angle of a wheelchair user. However, I was surprised to see in the video I found that the woman was able to see and reach the buttons on the top screen, as Figure 1 demonstrates.

The initial instinct of the woman in this scenario was to reach up towards the screen to follow the prompts. Immediately after this, she recognizes that the keypad below can be used to input her selections. From _How to Go to the Gas Station as a Wheelchair User_, by Danielle Marx, n.d. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KOHkaBfw9s).

To meet the definition of an accessibility problem, this barrier would need to prevent a user in the widest possible population from using the gas station. For the purposes of this assessment and with limited user testing information, it appears that a wheelchair user could see the labels from their vantage point, and therefore use this interface to meet the goal of dispensing gas. The secondary goal speaks to the comfort and ease of completing the task and creating a positive experience for the wheelchair user. Based on this video, it appears that an interface which requires looking up at a screen and using a set of buttons lower on the pump can be used comfortably by a wheelchair user. Using only this information, all goals pass and I would not consider this an accessibility problem. However, it may not be an ideal experience, especially if pumps are not fully covered and screen glare could obscure the labels. I would prefer to work directly with wheelchair users to better understand their experience and make a full assessment for this barrier.

The second barrier I noticed is much more straightforward, and most certainly an accessibility problem. As noted earlier, in a car with the gas door on the driver's side, the length of the nozzle prevents a wheelchair user from pulling far enough away from the pump to be able to get out and properly orient themselves to pump gas. Figure 2, which is a sketch I made to help myself understand this more clearly, demonstrates two scenarios. On the left, the car has the gas door on the passenger side, and the pump is easily accessible. On the right, the gas door is on the driver's side, and the length of the hose prevents the wheelchair-using driver from pulling away far enough to be able to turn the wheelchair around to face the gas door after getting out of the car. This barrier would disproportionately affect wheelchair users, and intersect with financial barriers. For example, a wheelchair user with a very limited budget may not have the financial means to choose which car they get, and ensure the gas door is on the passenger side.

### #3-S1 Hospital Gown

Goal:
- To allow a medical professional to easily and reliably examine a patient's body, while giving the patient a sense of comfort and privacy to the best extent possible.

Context:
- Hospital gowns are used in medical settings, where doctors and nurses are available and trained to assist patients who may have disabilities of varying types (physical, cognitive, etc).

Barriers and accessibility conclusions:

The first barrier I identified was that the ties on this gown are behind a person's head. The dexterity and muscular strength required to tie a bow tie behind your own head could be difficult or impossible to achieve for someone who struggles with dexterity or muscular strength in their arms. However, those same types of skills would likely be needed to undress as well. Given the context of the hospital, it is likely that someone with this type of disability would have the support easily available to receive private assistance in dressing and undressing. Therefore, I would not consider this an accessibility problem, because the context of the situation compensates for the barrier effectively.

The second barrier I identified is a cognitive barrier I personally struggle with: the lack of clarity in which direction the hospital gown is imtended to be put on. Clothing typically closes in the front and has indicators of the direction the clothing is intended to face on the clothing itself through tags and other markings. I am able to dress and undress myself, so I am always left on my own to change in and out of a hospital gown. I can never confidently remember which way the gown goes, which causes me stress and anxiety because I know I have a limited amount of time to figure out which way it goes, undress, and put the gown on. If I don't get it right, the doctor has to leave again, causing me to be embarrassed. While I am able to complete the task of getting the gown on, I am not able to do it comfortably and confidently. The additional stress of this task has an effect on me physically by increasing my heart rate and making it more difficult for me to answer questions. For people who struggle with the cognitive barrier of anxiety, lack of clear direction in a timed situation can be an especially stressful situation and may affect a doctor's physical assessment of their situation and care afterwards. Because this interferes with the goal of comfortable, reliable care, I would consider this barrier an accessibility problem.
