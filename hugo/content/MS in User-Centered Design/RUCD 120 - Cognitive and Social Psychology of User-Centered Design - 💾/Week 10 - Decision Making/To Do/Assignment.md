## Assignment: Title
White paper submitted as PDF; MAX 1500 words; double spaced;

In addition, submit a 1-2 paragraph reflection on your work with your partner.  What worked well? What didn't work as well? If you could do it over again, what would you ask of your partner to help you succeed in this assignment?

**Recommended Activities:  
  
**A minimum of 2 online meetings with your partner are required over the last 4 weeks of the course; more are recommended/encouraged. You will be meeting using an asynchronous remote working tool assigned to your group.  

-   Compare experiences about work settings
-   Brainstorm ideas for your paper
-   Conduct mini-interviews with friends/family/coworkers about their positive and negative work experiences. Share information with partner.
-   Conduct stealth field research by touring a coworking space.  Share information with partner.
-   Peer review of your partner's draft

Note: 10% of your grade will be based on the success of the collaboration with your partner. I suggest scheduling all your meetings ahead of time during week 7.

Note: For the third, final assignment, students will work in pairs to share information to complete their assigned version of this assignment. Peer collaboration will focus on sharing experiences and information, and draft review. The goal is to share information and work as a team to help each other deliver a better individual paper. 

The COVID pandemic has had a disruptive effect on office workers, forcing many who have worked in traditional office environments to work remotely for extended periods of time. Disruption often drives innovation, giving designers the opportunity to rethink the employee experience to improve employee motivation, productivity, satisfaction, and engagement.

### Assignment Version A (Remote Work)
US employees of Company A, a software development company, have been working remotely for over a year. The company already had a multi-national remote presence, and an office lease that expired a few months ago has resulted in significant savings. Therefore, leaders of Company A are planning on reducing the number of employees working on site by 80%, but they are worried that this move will increase employee turnover. Your boss, the VP of User Experience, has asked you to submit recommendations for supporting remote employees.

### Assignment Version B (On-Site Work)
US employees of Company B, a software development company, have been working remotely for over a year. Unfortunately, the pandemic coincided with the company’s  building of a new headquarters. Therefore, leaders of Company B are planning on having 80% of their workers return to the office as soon as possible, but they are worried that this move will increase employee turnover. Your boss, the VP of User Experience, has asked you to submit recommendations for improving the office environment to support in-person workers.

### Context for Both Scenarios
Recognizing and working within context and constraints is a critical capacity for designers. Consider both the benefits and drawback of designing the work settings in your scenario. Your proposal should include both recommendations for the design of the work environment, and how you can use technology to compensate for the drawbacks of each setting. Assume that both companies have a workforce that is diverse in terms of age, life stage, and individual preferences - think about what kinds of tools and  interventions may empower/or alienate individuals or stakeholder groups.

Connect with your partner weekly to brainstorm ideas and discuss the direction of your thinking.  Compare your own experiences in different work settings with those of your partner.

### Rubric

Content  
(0 to 80 points total)

Student discusses factors relevant to the assignment prompt. Submission includes references to a mix of class readings & resources. As always, consider the source, but for this assignment, references from reputable business and news publications (e.g. Harvard Business Review, The Economist) are acceptable.

Collaboration Reflection  
(0 to 10 points)

Student engages collaboratively with their partner to brainstorm ideas and share perspectives. Student attends all scheduled partner calls and communicates promptly about logistical challenges. Student provides feedback on their partner’s draft work. Student reflects on lessons learned from this collaboration.

Presentation/Style  
(0 to 10 points)

The submission uses plain language understandable by a non-designer business stakeholder. The information design makes it easy for the reader to follow the thoughts/discussions. References reflect independent research from reputable publications (e.g. HBR). Relevant references are included as inline footnotes, and follow APA style and include hyperlinks to the cited resource. The submission uses complete sentences and is free of spelling and grammatical errors.

My strong recommendation to everyone for assignment 3 is to use the structure from “The Three Environments That Create Every Employee Experience” (Part of Week 9 readings) to organize your paper.  That means that you will be making 3 categories of recommendations, and should give equal attention to each.  Start with an outline, and have your partner review it.  Many of the heuristics that apply to UI design (i.e. consistency, efficiency) also work well for any kind of presentation or paper you might be creating for school or for work. Think of these as just another type of design artifact.

A lack of enthusiasm for return to the office does not appear to be US-centric https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/7/why-some-ethnic-minorities-prefer-working-from-home

https://digiday.com/marketing/stamp-out-cultural-biases-how-return-to-office-strategies-differ-around-the-world/

In **Singapore**, 44% of those surveyed want to go back to the office, and in **Australia** it is 48%, with three days a week preferred. In **India**, 76% of workers want to return. This is according to a survey by workforce collaboration business Barco, which questioned knowledge workers in different industries and companies across the world.

Office occupancy rates across Asia in 2021 are already higher than for other parts of the world, said Raj Krishnamurthy, CEO at workplace technology solutions company Freespace. In May, 41% of office buildings in Asia had occupancy at more than 10%, up from 28% in January.

“There are several possible reasons for Asia’s higher figures. For example, its public health protection systems are more mature than the rest of the world, necessitated by the bird flu pandemic,” he said. “There are also cultural differences in comparison to other continents when it comes to presenteeism, while smaller homes in the big cities make it harder to work remotely.”

A Harris Poll of just over 2,000 workers reported in USA Today revealed that 40% of Americans would prefer to work from home full-time with only 25% keen to get back behind their office desks.

Separate research by Barco suggests many people will not have much choice. Some 74% of those questioned feel their CEO would prefer them to be in a physical shared office and the hybrid model is favored.

According to Freespace, just 6% of office buildings in the U.S. are currently operating above 10% occupancy.

Yes, people will likely quit. https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook

This could be due to status quo bias (Moleskis, Melissa, n.d.)
- **Make the alternative behavior easy to adopt.**
- **Make it personal** by connecting the change to individual employees in relevant and meaningful ways.
- Third option, make it about money - Can't incentivize in office by paying more - too likely to increase inequity/pay gap as a consequence https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220307-should-in-office-workers-be-paid-more.

# The Three Environments That Create Every Employee Experience

I define "employee experience" as an organization creating a place where people want to show up instead of assuming that people need to show up. This shift from "need" to "want" is the fundamental change that organizations around the world are starting to experience. 

**Physical Environment**
The physical workspace is the one we can see, touch, and taste, and smell. It’s the art that hangs on the walls, the office floor plan, the demographics of the people we work with (old, young, diversity, etc), and any physical perks we might get such as catered meals in a beautiful cafeteria, an on-site gym, or a lounge area that employees can use to unwind a bit. Before reading on think for a minute about your physical workspace and how it makes you feel. Do you get excited and energized or do you feel as if you are walking into a hospital or doctor’s office?
**Cultural Environment**
Some say “it’s what happens when the manager leaves the room,” others say culture stems from the values, attitudes, practices, and the mission of the organization, and some say culture is controlled by the CEO and the executives. Regardless of what you believe culture is or where it comes from, the one thing that is common is that culture is about feeling.
**Technological Environment**
The technological environment of the organization refers to the tools employees use to get their jobs done. This includes everything from the internal social network your company might use to the mobile devices that are approved to the laptops, desktops, and video conferencing solutions that employees have access to. This also includes any apps, software, e-learning tools, and user experience and design elements that impact how employees use these various tools.
