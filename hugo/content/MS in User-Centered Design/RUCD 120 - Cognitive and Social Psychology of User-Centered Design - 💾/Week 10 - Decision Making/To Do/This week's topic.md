## Final
Satisficing is a cognitive bias where a user will “settle for the first reasonable option (they) find, without considering the whole set of possibilities” (Bowman, 2020), and I struggle with this bias constantly in my work, as do many others in my role.

My current role is as a creative director, which means I am responsible for the work teams do on projects, and often determine the overall project direction. To keep work running quickly and smoothly, one thing I’m tasked with is attending intake meetings, and then giving my “gut feeling” about what the project will need to help estimate the budget. Because I have worked on many tight-budgeted projects in the past, I’ve created hundreds of mental shortcuts for how to get a lot done with little time or money, and if I don’t watch myself, these will translate to the project direction - often limiting the team to a solution before we’ve even conducted strategy to fully understand the problem. As an example that happened to me recently, my boss did an intake for our Fitness & Recreation Center, and upon hearing that there was an issue with users understanding hours, immediately satisficed the project by saying the fix should be relatively simple - we just needed a more prominent component for hours on the homepage. What I found out later through user interviews is that students were not looking at the website for hours at all - they were universally searching Google for these hours and looking at a card which was not always accurate, and didn’t reflect intricacies in things like pool hours closing before regular building hours or the center being closed over spring break.

As a side note: congratulations making it to the end of this class, everyone! It’s been so wonderful to discuss and learn with you all. Thank you for a wonderful first semester experience, and I hope to see familiar faces in the future!
