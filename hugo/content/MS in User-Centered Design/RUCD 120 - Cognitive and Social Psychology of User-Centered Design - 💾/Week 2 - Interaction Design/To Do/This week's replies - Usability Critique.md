# Usability Critique
Respond to one classmate's analysis of your own set, and one from the other set. 

Peer responses should add/expand on the original analysis, and perhaps **delve into alternate versions** (existing or of your own conception) of these products, especially ones that address a **potential weakness** described by your classmate.

## Bathroom amenities
Hi Steve! Great analysis. I agree with the weaknesses in this design you've pointed out, especially in using a button to control the faucet, and what appears to be a "second" button nearby that may cause confusion. In fact, as I look at these pictures, it seems like there is a lot of information to take in in many different places and languages, likely on all sides of the user in a very crowded space. To address these issues, I would propose a modified version of a Wash Bar, which is a sink design by Bradley Corp which combines soap dispenser, water faucet, and dryer into a single touchless basin and control bar (Bradley Corp, 2020). Figure 1 demonstrates how the unmodified Wash Bar design works.

**Figure 1**

A person places their hand underneath the far left of the Wash Bar to automatically dispense soap. After washing, they can place their hands under the middle to activate a water faucet, and under the far right to dry. The left to right, step by step ordering is intuitive and condenses the footprint needed for each item significantly, making it a good choice for the extremely limited space of a train restroom (Bradley Corp, 2020).

The Wash Bar design follows the pattern of most automatic sinks, but requires a signifier to help a user know which part of the bar does which job. The iconography is intuitive and shows the product a user can expect to get from that part of the faucet. However, the combination of smooth material, sleek design, and focus on the icon itself could lead a user to draw an unconscious parallel between this sink design and a smartphone, leading to a metaphor which wrongly suggests icons should be tapped to activate their functionality.

**Figure 2**

A similarity in materials and quality of design of the Wash Bar (left, Bradley Corp, 2020) to a smartphone (right, Apple, 2022) could lead a user to mistake the icons, which serve as signifiers on this sink, for touch controls. In the absence of other feedback and signifiers on this sink, the icons also draw a user's attention and focus most quickly. This could make it more likely that a user mistakes the signifier for a control.

On a parallel note, a problem I personally struggle with while using infrared sinks is understanding where the infrared area is, and if it is working properly. Because there is no signifier on where the infrared hit area is, if I do not receive the immediate feedback of the sink turning on, I can never tell if the problem is my hand positioning or the sink not being functional. 

To address both these problems at the same time, a light could be added under each faucet, with coloring to visually reinforce the purpose of the area. This light would show that the infrared area is functional and add a visible target to improve usability. Because the light attracts more attention and provides a target outside the icon, it may assist in breaking the unintentional metaphor of smartphone touch functionality. When an item needs service, a separate service icon could provide information on whether the sink needs service soon, such as a soap refill, or is experiencing a failure, such as a dryer failure. In the case of a failure, a lack of light from that spot in combination with the service light would make it immediately clear that the faucet needs attention from the service attendant, as illustrated in Figure 3.

**Process and alternate ideas**
- My initial reaction was to see if I could find the all-in-one sink, soap dispenser, and dryer I used recently at a local Wegman's. A design like this would make the best use of space in a highly constrained train restroom, and keep a user's focus in one place instead of requiring them to turn or find and focus on multiple locations around them. I found out the model is a [Bradley Advocate](https://www.bradleycorp.com/product/advocate-av-series-1-station), which led me to discover a newer model with a smaller physical footprint, the Wash Bar.
- I researched to see if there are any major usability barriers to automatic faucets and dispensers, and found a study testing different sink faucets with folks with dementia. This seemed like a good model for understanding possible cognitive barriers and solutions to sink design. For folks with moderate to severe dementia, lever-style sink faucets were the most successful in usability tests. For mild dementia, the infrared-style sink was used without error 80% of the time, while the lever-style sink had a 100% success rate. Most of these errors were the result of a location error - trying to interact with the sink, but doing so in the wrong place (Boger et al., 2013).
- While levers are technically more usable, an on-train restroom presents two unique challenges. First, water supply is limited, and lever-style sinks can be left on indefinitely. Second, on-train restrooms are small and heavily trafficked, and may have a perception of being less clean or sanitary than standard restrooms. Especially given the heightened awareness of cleanliness brought about by COVID-19, and the available resources on a train, a touchless solution seemed preferable for this context.
- I learned a plastic wand can be placed on a faucet spigot to turn it on and off when you place your hand below the faucet, which creates a physical target instead of relying on invisible infrared targets to turn the faucet on and off. However, I ruled this out due to the context above, and because it is not a standard pattern.
- This, in combination with my own experience with infrared sinks, led me to believe clearer feedback and signifiers in an infrared-style sink could compensate for the location errors experienced by folks with mild dementia, while addressing the needs of the train context, solving the unclear button control problem, and simplifying the overall design and flow of the restroom.

The obvious solution is to use exotic gestures or spoken commands, but how will we learn, and then remember, them? (Norman, 2013)


Hi Christine - I analyzed the Nintendo Switch Joycons as well! It’s great to read your perspective on them as a novice user. I’m on the other end of the spectrum, I use them all the time. The rounded edges make it much easier to hold them for sure.  
  
You make a really good point about the signifiers on the buttons being an especially weak point on Joycons. It was bad enough when you could only hold the controller one direction and had to learn what A, B, X, and Y mean, but when you split them apart to use as individual controllers the signifiers mean nothing at all anymore. I’m not even sure how game tutorials handle when this happens, because a tutorial can’t say “press A to jump” when one person is using the red half of the controller and “A” is actually sideways X because the controller is rotated, and the other person has the blue half with no letters at all, as in Figure 1 below.

When Joycons are rotated and used as individual controllers, signifiers on buttons are turned sideways, making it difficult or impossible to learn what buttons are associated with what functionality in games (Kolodziej, 2022).

---

  
There are two pretty big challenges here. One is that the meaning of A and B changes significantly from game to game and even from interaction to interaction within a game. For example, in a game that involves fighting interactions and social interactions, A could mean both “jump” and “talk” depending on the context. The second is the rotation of the controller. It seems like what’s really missing here is some way to change those signifiers on the fly that won’t distract advanced users or drain the battery on the controllers.

  

I wonder if eInk could be incorporated into the button design so that the button’s signifiers could be switched when the controller is in horizontal mode, keeping the signifiers consistent.
