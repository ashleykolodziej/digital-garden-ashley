#### Norman
human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of be-
having

Affordance-Relationship between properties of an object and the capabilities of agent that  determine how object Can be used

Affords - is for

Chair affords support, therefore affords sitting

Is for a single person to therefore affords  lifting
Determined by qualities of object and Agent Interacting
Affordance is nor a property it is a relationship
Anti affordance- prevents interaction
Must be perceivable to be effective

Glass - relative invisibility, but this aspect, so useful in the normal window, also hides 
its anti-affordance property of blocking passage. As a result, birds 
often try to fly through windows.
What are the obvious qualities?
An affordance is obvious and the result of rich amt of information in world

visible affordances provide strong clues to the  operations of things. A flat plate mounted on a door affords pushing. Knobs afford turning, pushing, and pulling. Slots are for in-
serting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. 

**Perceived affordances help people figure out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions. **

**Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both.**

Signifiers - a sign for where the action should take place, what it's for, what is happening, and alternative actions, a clue to understand

**Role of signifier is to communicate purpose**

Can be mark, sound, anything peciveable that communicates behavior to person

Signifiers can be deliberate and intentional, such as the sign 
push on a door, but they may also be accidental and unintentional, 
such as our use of the visible trail made by previous people walk-
ing through a field or over a snow-covered terrain to determine 
the best path

presence or absence of people waiting at a train station to determine whether we have 
missed the train

**When external signifiers—signs—have to be added to something as simple as a door, it indicates bad design**

bookmark, a deliberately placed signifier of one’s place in reading a book
physical nature of books also makes a bookmark an accidental signifier, for its placement also indicates how much of the book remains
Who cares, its helpful
Electronic book readers do not have the physical structure of paper 
books, so unless the software designer deliberately provides a clue, 
they do not convey any signal about the amount of text remaining.
Like detectives
we need to develop internal models of what things mean, of how they operate
Thoughtful designs provide clues

• Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the en-
vironment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.
• Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.
• Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and 
how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they 
fail to function.

My favorite example of a misleading signifier is a row of ver-
tical pipes across a service road that I once saw in a public park. 
The pipes obviously blocked cars and trucks from driving on that 
road: they were good examples of anti-affordances. But to my great 
surprise, I saw a park vehicle simply go through the pipes. Huh? I 
walked over and examined them: the pipes were made of rubber, 
so vehicles could simply drive right over them. A very clever sig-
nifier, signaling a blocked road (via an apparent anti-affordance) 
to the average person, but permitting passage for those who knew.

**A signifier can be words, a graphical illustration, or just a device whose perceived affor-
dances are unambiguous. **

Mapping - relationship between two sets of things
The mapping of switches to lights specifies which switch controls which light.

When the mapping uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the devices being controlled, it is easy to determine how to use them

All of these mappings for the control of vehicles work because 
each has a compelling conceptual model of how the operation of 
the control affects the vehicle

It doesn’t matter whether these conceptual models are accurate: what mat-
ters is that they provide a clear way of remembering and under-
standing the mappings. 

Natural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of spatial analogies, leads to immediate understanding

**Some natural mappings are cultural or biological**

Other natural mappings follow from the principles of perception and allow for the natural grouping or patterning of controls and feedback.

**Feedback : some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request.**

"Imagine trying to hit a ball when you can't see the target ""

 The human nervous system is equipped with numerous feedback mechanisms, 
including visual, auditory, and touch sensors, as well as vestibular and proprioceptive systems that monitor body position and muscle and limb movements

**Feed back must be immediate and informative - what has happened, and what can you do About it?**

auditory, in many cases we cannot even be certain which device has created the sound
light, we may miss it unless our eyes are on the correct spot at the correct time

**Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all, because it is distracting, uninformative, and in many cases irritating and anxiety-provoking**

Too much feedback can be even more annoying than too little - example microwave
But worst of all is **inappropriate, uninterpretable feedback**. The irritation caused by a “backseat driver” is well enough known that it is the staple of numerous jokes.

**Not only is it distracting to be subjected to continual flashing lights, text announcements, spoken voices, or beeps and boops, but it can be dangerous.**

Too many announcements cause people to ignore all of them, or wherever possible, disable all of them, which means that critical and important ones are apt to be missed - example bu alert "When every device is signaling a major emergency, nothing is gained by the result-
ing cacophony."

**Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, including a calm and relaxing environment.**

Actions need to be confirmed and feedback needs to be prioritized

A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works

Mental models, as the name implies, are the conceptual models in people’s minds that represent their understanding of how things work.

#### Factors which improve discoverability
**Signifiers and affordances:** I am able to see a circular border around each control in the panel, as well as see and likely feel a slight depression where each button is placed. This relationship between what I am able to see and the button's design affords pushing (Norman, 2013). Additionally, signifiers for the floor number are available in both a visual format and in braille, which allows both sighted and visually impaired users to understand which floor numbers are available.

#### Factors which impair usability

**Non-tactile signifiers:** The U.S. Access Board (2010) states that the main entry floor on an elevator control panel must have a tactile symbol representing the floor, as well as braille. This signifier is replaced by a non-tactile "Ground Floor" sign, which limits the ability to understand this building's conceptual model, or how the building is supposed to work (Norman, 2013), to sighted individuals.

**Non-standard mappings:** This elevator control panel also uses non-standard mappings for the ground floor. In *The Design of Everyday Things*, Donald Norman (2013) notes that "some natural mappings are cultural or biological." In North American and European floor mapping systems, the ground floor is typically numbered 1 or 0, respectively, and numbers are typically consecutive (“Storey,” 2022). The numbering system on this panel, which jumps from 5, to 4, to -1, would likely confuse a user in the North American or European populations because it goes against standard mappings in those regions and cultures. Further, a study of wayfinding preferences in hospitals found that in a similar conceptual model, where the ground floor was set to 3 and subfloors were 2 and 1, only 30% of participants would correctly identify 1 as the lowest level. 47% did, however, identify 1 as the ground level in this model (Carpman, J. R., Grant, M. A., & Simmons, D. A., 1983). This, along with the presence of a non-standard "ground floor" signifier (Norman, 2013), suggests that the mapping of the ground floor to level 4 likely did not match users' mental model of how floor numbers are mapped to building levels.

#### Factors which improve discoverability

**Barriers and guding constraints:** The door creates a physical barrier and a guiding constraint in that it will not open unless the bar, and only the bar, is pushed. When the user's attention is directed to the bar, lettering on the bar notifies them the door is an emergency exit before they push it. By introducing this constraint, the door's design makes it less likely that an alarm will accidentally be triggered (Lidwell et al., 2010), and more likely a user will discover and understand it is an emergency door.

**Signifiers and warnings:** If the bar is pushed, the door will open and an alarm will sound. Signifiers on the bar correctly use the color red to encourage stopping (_The Psychology of Safety Colors_, 2017) and clearly warns what will happen if you proceed, creating clarity in the door's behavior for sighted users.

#### Factors which impair usability
**Mental models and slips:** This type of door design is also used for non-emergency exits, which may cause a user to mistakenly intuit a "normal door" mental model of this door's functionality. For example, a rushed or distracted person may miss the visual cues that this is an emergency exit, and create a slip, or unintended execution of opening the door (Lidwell et al., 2010), since the design of the bar affords pushing and is a common pattern in doors. Similarly, because of the lack of braille and tactile warning signs, a visually impaired person may accidentally trigger the alarm.

**No confirmation or cancel actions:** While warnings are clear on the door, they are only clear to sighted users. There is no confirmation action or additional barrier that prevents accidental triggering of the alarm if a user misses or is unable to perceive the warnings on the door.

### Nintendo Switch Joycon Controllers

#### Factors which improve usability
**Gestalt principles and mental models:** Joycons leverage the Gestalt principle of grouping to make it easy to identify which sets of buttons are responsible for movement, and which are responsible for interaction and response. As Norman (2013) explains, "...natural mappings follow from the principles of perception and allow for the natural grouping or patterning of controls and feedback". In a Joycon, the controls for movement are located to the left, while controls related to interaction and responses are located to the right. Primary controls are located towards the top of the controller, which naturally sits where a thumb falls when using the Switch as a handheld system. Figure 1 demonstrates these patterns in relation to the mapping of historical gaming controllers, as well as how secondary controls are placed below to allow each Joycon to be used individually while maintaining the conceptual model of how Joycons work (_Nintendo Support: How to Hold the Joy-Con (Single and Multiplayer)_, n.d.). By leveraging existing historical patterns in gaming controllers, the Joycon activates existing mental models of gaming controllers its user base has built over a lifetime of gaming.

**Figure 1** 
*Comparison of Joycons in different use cases with NES controller*

Top: Joycons are attached to the system in handheld mode. When in hand, the thumb naturally falls near the primary control set (Kolodziej, 2022). Bottom left: Joycons may be detached and rotated for use as two individual controllers. The physical mapping of buttons to functionality changes, but the user's mental mapping of controls remains the same due to their relative physical location when rotated (Kolodziej, 2022). Bottom right: A photograph of the Nintendo Entertainment System controller, which demonstrates the original "reversed" B/A button pattern. Adult purchasers of the Switch, some of which are now parents, may have encountered this controller in their childhood (barry.good.games, 2016).

**Feedback:** A second factor which improves usability of the Joycon controller is feedback. Norman (2013) defines feedback as "some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request." In gaming, feedback is particularly important, as your focus is almost never attuned to the controller itself. The Joycon itself offers physical feedback in the form of the buttons having a smooth press downward and quick upward return, as well as a joystick which you can push and rotate, and immediately feel snap back when lifting your finger. 

However, the most important feedback in gaming is created in the relationship between controller, screen, and game logic. Certain games allow for innovative feedback and methods of control in the Joycon in their design. For example, in *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*, if rumbling is enabled in the Joycon when you cast a line out to fish, the controller will rumble when the fish is ready to reel in. This provides feedback and a signifier, similar to the pull you would experience in real life fishing, that it is time to press the A button to accept the fish pull interaction and "reel in" the fish. In Figure 2, *Fitness Boxing* leverages the movement sensor in the Joycon to send a signal to the game when a punching motion is activated at the correct time, providing auditory and visual feedback via a punching sound and animation on the TV screen. Providing feedback in this manner requires extremely low latency between the controller and gaming system, and achieves the goal in this game of letting the player know they've hit their target at the correct time.

**Figure 2**

A screenshot from a teaser trailer for Nintendo's *Fitness Boxing* demonstrates the relationship between two players, two sets of Joycons, and the near instantaneous feedback the game provides to the player when a correctly timed punch is placed (Nintendo, 2018).

#### Factors which impair usability

**Inconsistency and impairment of mental models:** A factor which impairs usability, depending on which gaming systems you have worked with in your lifetime, is the "reversal" of how A and B buttons are positioned on Nintendo controllers. This long-standing pattern continues in Joycons today, as shown in Figure 1, where B is to the left of the A button. The A button is usually used to either accept or initiate an interaction in the game, while B is typically used to cancel it.

The layout is so counterintuitive that Matthew Gallow, in *A Brief History of A and B* (2008), himself forgot that A was not to the left of B on Nintendo controllers - a clear indication that Nintendo controllers do not match his mental model that buttons should be positioned in alphabetical order. StackExchange UX poster Spiral13 guessed this decision may have been made because A is intended to represent the primary action, and the button closest to the right thumb would be the easier to access. 

While most gaming controllers have roughly the same shape and form factor, the physical positions of whether the A button or B button is in the leftmost position - or whether A and B are even used as the signifiers for accept and cancel - is completely different between all four major gaming manufacturers (Gallow, 2008). If you are not aware of these differences and it is your first time using a Nintendo controller when you grew up with Sega, Microsoft, or Sony patterns, a Joycon would likely be difficult to adjust to until you re-adjusted your mental model of the controller to accommodate how Nintendo places the A and B buttons.
