## Notes

Kristen - that pie chart ordering recommendation is so surprising to me that I had to go back and read it again because I didnâ€™t believe it. I truly always thought pie charts should be ordered the way you did in your first chart. Now that I see the comparison between your first and second chart, though, it does look a lot clearer to me. One thing that is bothering me is Wong never actually explains _why_Â she makes this recommendation, and I canâ€™t quite make sense of it myself. I teach design classes and thought it might be related to eye tracking and the rule of thirds, but when I went back to check it was the lower right quadrant, not the lower left, that was read last in a typical image.
