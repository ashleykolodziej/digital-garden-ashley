## Assignment: Human Factors Critique
During the first assignment, students will explore the usability and accessibility of a set of designs. For each design, discuss relevant human factors, including:
- Physical (Ergonomic & Haptic)
- Cognitive/Literacy
- Perceptual (Visual & Auditory)
- Social/Cultural

For each design, provide:
- a summary of its strengths and weaknesses
- redesign suggestions for improving its usability and/or inclusiveness, if applicable. 

No design is perfect, though some of the designs shown may have more strengths than weaknesses. You don’t have to cover every factor with every design - **focus on what is most critical to the primary purpose of the design or device**, and what you can glean about the context of use from the information provided (and your own research). 

Most of your analysis should be based on what you’ve learned in Weeks 1-3, but informed by additional research as needed. In describing the social and cultural context of the designs you can draw on your own background and experiences.

### Guidelines for Assignment 1
- Use the attached [**Google Doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCHUAqc6hlT8hnW-aAKM4c_vs1LriEDJEN7aYlBUJ_o/edit?usp=sharing) template (you can adjust for vertical screenshots) to analyze a [set of 5 designs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1waj3Xn7tZfoUezLPBAKH9xYCriVxGksPvNR9kTFYVew/edit?usp=sharing).  
- Your analysis should refer to the range of concepts and topics we covered in weeks 1-3 that are relevant to the design of physical devices. 
- Use the terminology we are learning heavily (e.g. affordances, feedback, mental models, etc.). 
- You don't have to define your terms, but include enough detail for the reader to understand where and how a particular principle or concept applies.
- Avoid using vague words like 'intuitive' or 'user-friendly.'
- Include appropriately sized photos to help the reader understand your discussion
- Each critique should be approximately 500 words x 5 (not including references), for a total of up to 1600 words (content beyond 1500 words will not be graded).
- Sharing of interesting references or articles with each other is OK, but the analysis should be your own, and you should submit an individually written paper.
- On the assignment due date, share a PDF of the Google Doc.
- Style, grammar, and spelling will account for 10% of your grade.
- 1-2 paragraph reflection (submitted separately) will count for another 10% of your grade (see rubric for details).
