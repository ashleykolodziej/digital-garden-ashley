# Supporting Cognitive Limitations
**Initial Post**: In light of this week's readings about the capacities and limitations of human and artificial intelligence, describe two experiences you've had with technology, one positive and one negative. Draw from the learning materials this week and ensure vocabulary and key terms are used where appropriate.  

For the positive experience, consider how an app or device saved you time, helped you focus, improved your productivity, did the math for you, or otherwise supported you in accomplishing a task.

For the negative experience, consider a case where the technology posed a barrier, distracted you, wasted your time, manipulated you, or missed the mark in some fundamental way.

**Criteria**: Students will produce one initial post (approx. 250 words) and post two replies (approx. 150 words).

### Attention and design
**selective attention** at work. When you need to focus your attention on a specific, important task, your brain adeptly shuts out these low-priority environmental stimuli, banishing them to your subconscious and allowing you to affix your attention to the task at hand.

**Startle response:** The crash was visceral and unexpected, and it contrasted with the humdrum background noise of the coffee shop. This kind of interruption, part of the startle response, is innate and defensive, and it triggers one of the most instantaneous reactions that the brain is capable of performing.

**Emotional distraction:** We have a very large emotional investment in our own name, and hearing it spoken is an occurrence most of us find difficult to ignore.

The brain, essentially, decides what in our environment is immediately important to us and, more often than not, we acquiesce. If you’ve ever experienced the kind of unavoidable distractions discussed earlier, you probably would have spent a few post-distraction minutes more aware of those previously dulled stimuli.

**attentional filter** responses to sensory(the loud crash or the colorful outfit) and emotional (our name being spoken) distractions
- attentional system also allows for switching between an intrinsically task-focused mode to a more reflective one

**task-positive mode** a state of mind exemplified by the intense focus on a single task

**Processing types**
-   _Bottom-up_: Fast, instinctive and intuitive, subconscious.
-   _Top-down_: Slower, more reflective, conscious.

System 1, he suggests, works heavily on heuristics and cognitive biases. It is “intuitive thinking.” System 2, on the other hand, is “rational,” working at measured, more meticulous levels.

**Default mode network:** our minds wander and we daydream until we need to do something, and once we’re done, we’re back to meandering.
- stimulus-independent thought—essentially a category of images and thoughts that are outside of, and unrelated to, our immediate environmental stimuli
- While there remains no direct evidence of the network’s association with creativity, there is growing research and theories that link the mind’s resting state with divergent thought (a simplification of what goes on in our mind when we’re “being creative”).
- For clinically depressed individuals, the daydreaming, projection, and self-analysis of this mental mode can instead be taken over by feelings of guilt and shame - depressive rumination
- For every exciting projection of ourselves into the future as the atomic “me” we strive to be, there’s the shame-ridden journey to the past—where we accidentally called our teacher _Mum_ or our sexual partner _Adrian_.

**Focused (task-positive) mode dangers**
- Being overly devoted to a single task can lead to a rather damaging myopia and a state of tunnel vision. Furthermore, a notable number of social anxiety episodes are triggered by intense hyper-focus on a specific reaction, phrase, or gesture.
- Hyper-focus on a task or activity can also often cause us to lose track of time, result in mental over-exertion, and lead to stress and irritability.
- numerous cases of otherwise-healthy people so engrossed with high-pressure work and demanding tasks that they suffer health complications, some of which prove to be tragically fatal.

#### Cons of distractions
- attentional system, like a muscle, has a finite and depleting amount of energy available to it
- By asking our brains to switch focus throughout our daily life, we’re actively depleting these energy stores. The constant depletion of this energy without the requisite replenishment from a good old rest can result in damaging levels of mental fatigue, irritability, and burnout.

**Decision making**
- By attaching actions beyond simply consuming the content, we’re raising myriad questions and decisions. _Do I read this? Do I trust it? Do I like it? Should I respond? Report it? Should I ever, ever read the comments?_
- Once we enter this state of depletion, we’re cognitively hamstrung, unavoidably bottom-up thinkers, and we make more mistakes more often.
- Allowing the mind to wander, taking a break to eat, and getting a good night’s sleep are all remedies for a nutrient-starved mind and, somewhat ironically, are all things that distractions, interruptions, and notifications often keep us from indulging in.
- Glenn Wilson has shown that simply through knowing you have an unread email in your inbox, your effective IQ during task-positive focus can be lowered by as much as 10 points - almost double casual marajuana use
- attributed to a compelling need to respond

**Inclusivity and equity**
- attention is a privilege
- Neurodivergent individuals will often find their attentional system and central executive hampered, imbalanced, or abnormal in some way
- the cognitive impact of poverty can be similar to that of a 13-point IQ decrease
	- While we may assume that our products and interfaces are not cognitively over-burdening, and we might even attempt to validate that through user testing, this thinking and testing is borderline pointless if we’re not considering vulnerable, exhausted, and impaired people.
- if you’re making decisions on the back of testing sessions that don’t account for a cognitive load (simulated, at the very least) and attentional depletion, you are doing a disservice to many of the people who might rely on your product
	- Try giving your subjects math problems, of varying difficulties, to consider during the test. This is a common tactic used in neuroscience and psychology experiments to provide a vulgar-yet-utilitarian simulation of cognitive load. Or, even better, have them perform the test on a system that is pinged with varying levels of intermittent notifications, as one may experience in real life. Test your interface often, under various levels of distraction and depletion, and you’ve already made a step toward a more-inclusive practice .
- it’s much easier to fall into the trap of assumptions when it comes to the invisible and the in-betweens in our work
- if we’re diligent with our decisions and honest about how much attention our product or feature actually warrants, we have made the first steps to building a product that people can decide to ignore when they need to and that is conducive to focus when it needs to be
- Some of the best products out there make no noise at all and, when used, allow for faster and deeper immersion in a task.

**habit-changing products**—think Duolingo for learning a new language through daily practice or apps such as Offtime and Moment that aim to mitigate social media addiction

**smoke alarm products** alert systems for natural disasters, glucose monitoring 

most apps will have aspects that require both simple, low-effort consumption and purposeful friction or distraction to instigate slower thinking and garner focused attention

GitHub - type repo name before delete, attention-grabbing

Too often we convince ourselves that our products are deserving of smoke-alarm levels of attention when the reality is far more humbling.

Small degrees of mindful friction or slight difficulty bumps here and there can actively promote learning and memorization—it’s part of why education apps are so heavily gamified these days

**cognitive miser theory** is rooted in the notion that the low-effort, bottom-up processes will generally win out in situations where they can be safely applied

**neglectful design** In what sane, empathetic world does someone lump births, deaths, and marriages into the same category? Imagine having to register a death certificate for a recently deceased loved one and being asked to sift through content about newborn children and new marriages.

from a real-world, top-down perspective, poor categorization can have an emotional impact ranging anywhere from mildly frustrating to actually rather harrowing

the core of almost any design decision lies in grouping and manipulating content based on its current importance in a given situation—to highlight the content that is relevant and to quieten the content that is not.

**Context-aware UI** Muting or blocking someone might be categorized as “actions performed against a user,” and sharing or reporting a tweet as “actions performed against a tweet.” However, in a situationally dependent category of “actions performed when a tweet is awful as heck,” muting and blocking the tweet’s associated user are quite clearly members of this category.

## 100 things
People can only remember 4 items at once
**Chunking** 712-569-4532
3-4 items per group. Too many groups? 3-4 groups per group.

Similarly I could talk about the “eye.” You would think about all the things that make up an eye: the eyeball, iris, eyelash, eyelid, and so on. The head is a **schema**. The eye is a schema. People use **schemata** (plural for schema) to store information in long-term memory and to retrieve it.

If people can connect new information to information that is already stored, then it’s easier to make it stick, or stay in long-term memory, and easier to retrieve it.

Experts Store Information as Schemata

Recognition is Easier than Recall

In the memory test at the beginning of this chapter, you memorized a list of words and later wrote them down. This is called a _recall task_. If instead I had shown you a list of words, or even walked you into an office and asked you which items were on the list, I would have been giving you a _recognition task_.

Errors of inclusion - something exists in your schema but wasn't in the original list

It takes a lot of mental resources to think about, remember, process, represent, and encode information.

Recency effect - You’re most likely to remember what was seen and heard at the end of the talk.

concrete terms and icons will be easier to remember than abstract ideas or images.

Information in the middle of a presentation is the least likely to be remembered.

## Draft
### Positive: ReMarkable 2
I use a ReMarkable 2, which is an e-Ink tablet (similar to a Kindle), except its only purpose is to replace a physical notebook for taking notes. I find it's an excellent example of calm technology because it easily moves into my periphery (Ravi, 2020). It has a very long battery life, so just like a paper notebook, I can keep it in my purse or on my desk and not even think about it until it's time to take notes.

In _Mindful Design_, Scott Riley (2019) states that "some of the best products out there make no noise at all and, when used, allow for faster and deeper immersion in a task." The ReMarkable 2 has no notifications or sounds at all. The physical sensation of opening a cover and writing on a surface similar to paper gets me into task positive mode by giving my brain the job to record/process inportant feedback in a meeting. This helps me filter down environmental stimuli like background music or office noise to keep my focus on the conversation. Flexible and thoughtful uses of guiding constraints also help keep me organized, such as its notebook structure and page templates. I like to use lined templates to take formal notes, dot grid or blank for sketching, and a special planner template I made on my own to help me visually track the time I plan to take for tasks since I bill my work hourly at my day job.

One of the reasons I can use the ReMarkable 2 so quickly and easily is that the design matches my schema of a notetaking device (Weinschenk, 2020). I think of a pen and paper when I think of notetaking devices, and with this product I can open the cover to the left, flip it over, write, and flip the pen to erase. Writing notes by hand rather than typing also improves learning and memory by activating deeper processing of the information in the brain (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014), and anecdotally, has given me a more positive impression towards others who watch me as a leader in meetings than laptop notes would. I love that this device is exactly like my pen and notebook used to be, but adds text recognition so I can export and email notes to text, and syncing to my Google Drive.

### Negative: Facebook

I recently deleted Facebook and Instagram after the Wall Street Journal reported that researchers at Facebook reported that Instagram could worsen teen mental health issues (Seetharaman, 2021). I recorded my feelings during the process of deleting Facebook in a blog post, and some of the major themes included having to change my mental model of how a technology that was supposed to help me was harming me and others, fear and dependence on Facebook as a communication method, loss of all the small moments I recorded about my life and self, and addiction and withdrawal (Kolodziej, 2021). After this week's reading, I understood much more clearly how much this really impacted me on a day to day basis.

The task I hoped to complete with Facebook was to be entertained, catch up with friends, and view a few memes. Looking back on the environment created in the app, it was very noisy. I would scroll and scan to see what interested me and I could share. Each of these many posts, which felt never ending, required me to make a decision to react, ignore, consider, or share (Riley, 2019), and then more decisions in how to phrase a response. Facebook created a high level of emotional distraction in me because I am very invested in my friends. Whenever I saw a response to a post which could hurt them, I was unable to ignore it, and would constantly check back to defend them.

Phrasing responses also took a huge toll on me. I found myself second-guessing and changing what I posted in anticipation of possible replies and reactions to what I was saying. In some cases, I would change what I wanted to share with friends or family because I was afraid of the reaction it would create not just with them, but friends of their friends. When I posted something that was important to me, but I deemed "risky", I would check back and return constantly to make sure the feedback was still positive. Instead of allowing my mind to rest in default mode (Riley, 2019), using Facebook created a situation where I had fear-based ruminations during my rest periods. I also felt manipulated when I realized how much any type of feedback on a post in social media, positive or negative, changed what I shared with my friends and family.

The process of deleting Facebook is attention-grabbing (hard to accidentally do) but also has an extremely long wait time - any login in the next 30 days stops the deletion process (Facebook, n.d.). It also reminds you that you cannot use Messenger or other means of communication once you do it. Although this is a necessary warning sign, because I had become dependent on Facebook for communication and was afraid of not having that connection, it made it very difficult to continue with the deletion process.

The only social media I continue to use actively is Reddit. Because it is anonymous and not attached to my personal identity, the emotional and cognitive load it puts on me outside the app is much lower.

The process of deleting Facebook is attention-grabbing in that it is hard to accidentally do. However, it also has an unnecessarily long wait time. Any login in the 30 days after you delete Facebook stops the deletion process altogether, and must be restarted (Facebook, n.d.). It also reminds you that you cannot use Messenger or other means of communication when you initiate the deletion process. Although this is a necessary warning sign, because I had become dependent on Facebook for communication and was afraid of not having that connection, it made it very difficult to continue deleting my account. Many websites I used were also tied to Facebook login, so there was a huge barrier in sorting through ten years' worth of apps and websites that were tied to that account to find out how to reset passwords so I wouldn't get locked out of them.
