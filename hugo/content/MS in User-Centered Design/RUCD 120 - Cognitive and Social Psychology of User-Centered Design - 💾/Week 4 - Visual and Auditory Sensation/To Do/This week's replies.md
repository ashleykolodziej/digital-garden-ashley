Hey Whitney and Amara! Thank you for sharing your experiences - I would have expected more from such major e-commerce sites. It's amazing how difficult browsing the web becomes with a screen reader. I've used VoiceOver on Mac before to test websites at my job, but I've never tried it on an iOS device, so I tried it with National Grid, with the goal of paying my gas bill online. It was doable, but difficult.

I definitely agree the experience reinforced the need for alt text for me. I also discovered how important including specific context in button text is. I had two different Select Account buttons and couldn't tell which account I was selecting because of that. Even though the action those buttons would take was clear, it wasn't clear enough to really know what would happen if I tapped them.

This experience also reinforced having adequate touch target sizes for me, which I wasn't expecting. I found myself accidentally switching between reading two small targets at the same time, and had a hard time finding close and back buttons.

I've never thought about the bank or email thing but you're totally right Whitney, I'd never want to check that in public without headphones if I relied on a screen reader.

## Steps I took and notes
My mental model of how VoiceOver on iOS works is based on a video I watched a while back. In it, a woman named Molly Burke (2015) drags her finger along the screen to read text and interactive elements, and then double taps when she wants to open an app. I used that method to navigate, and tried to blindfold myself at first. I couldn't keep track of where my finger was relative to my iPad screen and got lost, so I used a three finger triple tap to turn on screen privacy so the screen was "off" while I tried to navigate (Apple, 2022).

I tried to change the region to my local region. I got totally lost because I expected the controls to be in a drop down menu, and I kept dragging my finger down to try and read the items underneath. It seemed like everywhere I swiped my finger, all I could hear was error feedback. I had to turn off screen privacy to find out I was in a modal, and where I should be feeling.

After getting the right region, I thought I'd be done - but it turned out there was a second modal. Since there wasn't an announcement of the modal, I had no idea and got lost again the same way as I did in the last step. I looked up how to read off a page from the start around this time, and that helped a bit.

Without visuals, the reading off of all the actions reminded me of the menus you get when calling customer service. Normally, I would go straight to the login page, but I was surprised when I immediately went for Pay Your Bill the minute I heard it. This eventually led to a login page. I was pleasantly surprised how easy the login was - my password was saved, and Face ID verified my identity quickly and announced it was doing so when I chose to auto fill it. For the rest of my struggling, that was actually pretty seamless.

I was able to get to this bill payment page, but since both buttons only say "Select Account", I couldn't tell whether I was selecting my gas bill or electric bill. When I only had my finger and VoiceOver to rely on, I didn't have the context of the surrounding information to help me understand which button belonged to which account.

I think I would have been able to pay my bill eventually, but it would have been very difficult. I might not be using VoiceOver to the full extent possible. As a last action, I thought I'd see if I could understand what my past energy usage was. That didn't work, since even though all text was readable by VoiceOver, the bars require vision to know the value they represent on the graph.
