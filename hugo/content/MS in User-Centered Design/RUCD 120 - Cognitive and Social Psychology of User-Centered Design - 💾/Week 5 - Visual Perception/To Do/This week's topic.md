# Gestalt Principles
**Context**: In this week's readings, Riley posits that the harmony produced using Gestalt cues is both “necessary” and “boring."

**Initial Post**:  Identify and analyze a UI (1 or 2 screens only) that makes effective use of Gestalt principles. What Gestalt principles did the designers use to create harmony? Does this interface strike you as boring? If it does, is 'boring' the appropriate design choice for the context of use? If not, what kinds of suggestions would you make to the designers to add interest? If the UI is not boring, what visual tricks did the designers use to offset the potentially somnolent effects of Gestalt? 

**Replies**: In your replies, comment on the original posts. We are keeping things light this week.  This post is a warm-up for your next assignment. 

**Criteria**: Students will produce one initial post (approx. 200 words) and post two replies (approx. 50 words).

### Mindful design
Scott McCloud theorizes that the more “iconic” an image is, without losing its meaning, the higher chance that we’ll apply to it some of our self by attaching our own inferences. Icon abstraction, personalization, insertion

what we “see” when we look at these works actively changes based on our working mental models of the world. 

When there is a form to be found, we will usually find it. (See Figure [2-3](orm-local:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/5F951E27-01D1-4139-817E-2DE850E1A5B5/Library/Application%20Support/downloads/books/9781484242346/html/#Fig3).) In fact, even when there is no explicit depiction of form, we can always convince ourselves there is.

In modern interface design, our abstract art generally takes form as illustration and iconography. 

When presenting people with simple illustrations and icons, we’re not only able to imply meaning with fewer stimuli to process—reducing the overall visual complexity of our work—but we’re also giving people space to further interpret what they see.

**Gestalt**
- proximity: objects that are closer to each other are seen as grouped. 
- Similarity: items with similar appearances and physical qualities will be grouped together. Can be a signifier, as in text links/color.
- continuity: elements that are aligned with each other are perceived as grouped due to our natural desire to visually “follow through” an element along a specific path or in a specific direction
- common fate: items that move along a similar or shared path are seen as related—an insight that should heavily inform our animation design decisions
- Principle of Closure shows that we’ll “fill in” forms that don’t actually exist—provided there’s a “hint” to that form

Non-gestalt
- Common Region Principle states that, quite simply, elements that are contained within the same region are seen as grouped

In reality, we’d be pretty useless as a species if our emotional stability was so innately tied to something as ubiquitous and varied as color.

We are evolutionarily inclined to respond to “contrast” of many kinds, something that color can have a profound impact on, but the notion that certain colors can make us feel certain emotions is overplayed and overhyped.

The von Restorff Effect explains what I believe to be one of the key underlying principles of visual design: the technical conclusion of everything we do boils down to accommodating contrast.

change and importance are huge factors when it comes to the subject of our attentional focus, and we primarily communicate this through contrast (Figure 2-15).

von Restorff Effect, also known as the “isolation effect” and discovered by Hedwig von Restorff, is a visual bias theory that suggests when presented with various similar items, the most different item will be easier to notice and recall.

homogeneous elements become less memorable, and perceived as less important, in the presence of the isolation effect’s trigger.

Just like Gestalt, the isolation effect only “works” in an environment of limited stimuli.

we can, to a degree, introduce and communicate the use and importance of any interface paradigm (color, depth, typography, etc.) to someone in a way that “marks” that paradigm as meaning a specific thing, or conveying a specific use.

The vividity of the ladder’s color and the fact that it’s isolated from its surroundings makes it stand out—and as part of our onboarding into the game and the affordances we associate with the ladder (we know, from our exposure to the world, that ladders, rope, etc., are all members of the functional category “things we can climb”), we’re taught, quite effectively, that we can climb this.

In seeing something that contrasts with its environment and being able to interact with an object of that color in a specific and consistent way, we’re able to manufacture our own, very specific, affordances.

willingness to accept a simpler signal as a proxy for a more complex one.

We know, through the isolation effect, that it is an element’s overall contrast against its environment, not necessarily something as reductionist as its color, that makes it notable. 

but given the oft-reported notion that “CTA color” can have a radical impact on conversion rate, and the first-class-citizen status of YouTube in Google’s product ecosystem, I think it’s safe to assume that this idea has been tested rather extensively. “Stay away from red” is reductionist, prescriptive, and pointlessly constraining.

**Animation**
- functional, utility-focused idea of animation as a means of providing contrast
- a tool of effective cognitive economy and as a learning aid
- communicating character traits and eliciting an emotional response

animation is probably the single most-contrasting aspect of any interface. If something moves, especially against a still backdrop, it’s almost impossible for our brain to not register it as important

we need to be cognizant of the impact animation can have on our effective baseline of stimuli.

if we need to animate two separate blocks of content simultaneously (this happens often if we wish to communicate a change in state, for example, changing an active tab)—we can very easily communicate this contextual separation by simply animating one block in from the left, and the other from the right.

animation is extremely effective when used as a “signifier.” An element’s potential interactivity can be communicated through animation better than almost any visual cue we could provide. A super-common example of this approach is mobile apps that have horizontal scrolling areas (Figure 2-18). These apps will often have these scrollable elements begin at their “final” scroll position (usually all the way scrolled to the right) and then animate an auto-scroll to the “starting” position when the element is in view.

Animation itself can also be used to communicate a state, such as the iOS home screen reshuffling shown in Figure 2-19. All the icons on the screen appear to be energetically vibrating, hinting (albeit rather conspicuously) that, in this state, icons can be dragged around at will.

Finally, there is an emotional side of animation. If we think of an interface partly as a conversation (regardless of whether it’s a trendy chatbot or not), then its animations can be seen as the subtle nods and hand gestures that psychologists know as “kinesics.”

any element you add to an interface performs two detrimental actions. First, it reduces the importance of any homogeneous or similar elements in its vicinity. Second, it increases the density of stimuli in your work.

focus on convention and metaphor

Convention has us looking at underlined, differently colored text amid a paragraph (Figure 2-22) and accepting it’s a link.


### Draft
I chose to evaluate the Persona 5 battle user interface for this week's post. Since it's a video game about teenage vigilantes, with an almost overwhelming amount of visual references to punk culture and ransom notes, it's about as far as you can get from a "boring" user interface. When I looked at this through a gestalt lens, I realized how much gestalt principles aid in making this interface manageable and enjoyable to use.

The battle interface in Persona 5 demonstrates how gestalt principles assist gamers in prioritizing information on the screen that relates to their actions in that moment (Reggy, 2019).

**Proximity:** The action menu, battle controls, and health meter areas all leverage the gestalt principle of proximity to create distinct groupings. My favorite use of this is in the placement of the action menu, which overlaps the current character slightly. Throughout the battle, this menu's placement changes so that is it always next to the character whose actions you are controlling. The overlapping of the action menu over the character creates a clear relationship between the actions you can ask characters to take and the character who will carry out the action at that time (Riley, 2019).

**Similarity:** In our reading this week, Scott Riley (2019) explained that the gestalt principle of similarity allows us to group items "with similar appearances and physical qualities", and that color similarity will override other types of similarity. In this interface, a red outline is used to signify which participants in the battle, such as the character and enemy target(s), will be affected by your decisions as a player. There are many other types of groupings in this interface, such as characters, enemies, and menus, but by using color as a signifier, the most critical grouping of who your actions will affect in the battle creates a new, more important relationship which overrides other existing groups (Riley, 2019).

**Continuity:** The health meters at the bottom of the screen are lined up neatly, creating a grouping through continuity, but I also see a deliberately designed lack of continuity that draws your attention to the selected character's health meter. The isolation effect theorizes that when given an item of stark contrast relative to surrounding items, a viewer will be more likely to remember the contrasting item and forget the rest. Continuity keeps the meters grouped together, but the larger selected meter and interruption of the top line continuity makes the selected character's meter stand out as most important, and allows a gamer to deprioritize the others.

A neat aside is that the actions menu not only has button signifiers which match the button signifiers on a PlayStation controller - their location on screen also maps to the location of the buttons on the controller itself. I’ve spent over 90 hours playing this game and never noticed this connection until today.
