## Assignment 2 - Expert Review (Heuristic Evaluation)

For this assignment, students will conduct a heuristic evaluation of a primarily visual UI design of their choice. The UI should include a transactional task component (e.g. ecommerce, banking, social media, or web app).  At minimum, the presentation should include an analysis of the home page and a multi-step task or interactive process (e.g. registration, checkout, or social media posting). The target audience for this presentation is a team of design stakeholders, including senior management. The graded deliverable will be a pre-recorded meeting presentation and accompanying slide report.

  

For your analysis, choose 1-2 relevant guidelines from each of the 6 CARMEL heuristic categories listed below (for a total of 10 guidelines).  When relevant, connect the guideline to familiar concepts from weeks 1-6 [see info in brackets]. 

### Part I: Report Deck

Develop a slide deck report to support the verbal presentation. Include table of contents, annotated screenshots, and enough information to prompt recall of key takeaways from the presentation.

### Part II: Verbal Presentation

Record a 10-15 minute MAX verbal presentation. Begin with a brief  (<1 minute) description or demo of the goals and purpose of the UI, then analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the design using the [CARMEL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16mEY47BwRdZxcwxfyIs1_g9cANk9xRMf1kzQEUM-A3k/edit#heading=h.sqm8wj724cid) heuristic framework. 

### Submission Guidelines

  

-   This is an individual assignment. The deliverable will take the form of a slide deck and pre-recorded presentation.
    
-   Choose a visual UI that’s complex enough to warrant a detailed analysis (websites, web applications, and mobile apps are all acceptable).
    
-   Evaluate 3-5 key screens (home page + interactive process).
    
-   Use a blank (white background) slide deck template to create a presentation deliverable.
    
-   Include a summary slide citing the strengths and weaknesses of your chosen design
    
-   Include a list or table of the guidelines you used
    
-   Include annotated screenshots and bulleted lists on the slides (i.e. do not fill your slides with long paragraphs of text). You are welcome to include notes on each slide to help you present the material, but you will be graded on your verbal presentation only. I recommend AGAINST writing out exactly what you plan to say, as this is likely to make your presentation feel  less spontaneous. 
    
-   Include an appendix of references (that can overlap with references from Assignment 1, but should include references that apply to screen interface design only).
    
-   Use Zoom (no other tools are acceptable) to create your recording. Share your screen and turn on your Webcam.
    
-   Record a 10-15 minute voiceover recording of your presentation. Assume a basic knowledge of the concepts discussed in your presentation. Presentations that exceed the 15 minute limit by more than 2 minutes will not be graded on content beyond the 15 minute mark.
    
-   When you prepare for your verbal presentation, keep this quote in mind, often attributed to [a US President](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/01/short-speech/): “If I am to speak ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; If an hour, I am ready now.” Imagine that you are one of 4 presenters at an hour-long work meeting attended by a VP of User Experience whose time and attention is limited.
    
-   If you found the reflection for assignment 1 useful, feel free to submit one for this assignment as well, but it will not receive extra credit. 
    

  

On the assignment due date, submit a link to your recording, a PDF version of the slides, plus an (optional) reflection.

  

### Rubric

  

Content  
(0 to 60)

Student’s evaluation demonstrates a deep knowledge of key usability and design concepts relating to visual interface design. Submission includes references to a mix of class readings/resources and student’s independent research on human factors, standards & guidelines.

Slide Design  
(0 to 20 points)

The submission is clearly organized, with effective visual and information design. Effective use of Gestalt and preattentive principles makes it easy for the reader to follow the discussions. References are appended to the slide deck, follow APA citation style, and include hyperlinks to the cited resource. The submission is free of spelling and grammatical errors. 

Verbal Presentation Style

(0 to 20 points)

The verbal presentation complements and significantly expands on the information covered in slides. The student does not read from slides. Appropriate level of professional language is used (i.e. no slang). The presentation is fluent and well-rehearsed.

  
  

### Kaniasty’s CARMEL Guidelines 

[choose 1 or 2 relevant items from each category for a total of 10 to cover in your presentation]

  

The CARMEL guidelines are loosely inspired by Nielsen’s usability heuristics, but incorporate knowledge and standards that have emerged since Nielsen’s principles were published over 20 years ago, including best practices for accessibility.

#### Consistency

[Aesthetic and functional consistency, Gestalt]

  

1.  Consistent visual style  
    The design follows branding or style guides that dictate the use of logos, color, and typography.
    
2.  Design systems  
    The design follows a cohesive set of human interface guidelines or design patterns.
    
3.  Naming conventions  
    Naming conventions are consistent across pages and UI elements.
    
4.  Look & feel  
    Layouts and page elements have a cohesive look and feel.
    
5.  Interactions  
    Similar interactions (e.g. microinteractions, transitions, widget states) behave consistently. 
    

#### Accessibility

[think back to the toolkit we developed in week 4]

  

1.  Font size  
    The design meets minimum font size legibility guidelines.
    
2.  Contrast  
    The design meets guidelines for minimum contrast between text and background.
    
3.  Double coding  
    Visual information is ‘double-coded’ for accessibility by users with color blindness or other visual impairments.
    
4.  Target size  
    The design meets guidelines for minimum target size for mouse and touch targets.
    
5.  Screen Readers  
    The design meets W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for users of screen readers.
    

#### Recovery

[Constraints, feedback, forgiveness]

  

1.  Confirmation dialogs  
    Destructive or high-impact actions require confirmation.
    
2.  Undo  
    Undo functions prevent major data loss and unintended consequences.
    
3.  Error messages  
    Error messages include instructions for recovery.
    
4.  Version control  
    Version control, history or archive functions are built into data intensive or collaborative workflows.
    
5.  Autosave/System recovery  
    Auto-save and/or cookies maintain session state and prevent accidental data loss. The system mitigates impact of catastrophic errors, crashes, and network outages.
    

#### Memory

[Hick’s Law, memory limitations, feedback, signifiers]

  

1.  Limited choices  
    Lists of critical choices (menu options, navigation categories) are visible in a single view, or limited to <10 items.
    
2.  Automatic calculations  
    The system ‘does the math’ for the user.
    
3.  Feedback  
    Microcopy and microinteractions provide ongoing feedback to the user.
    
4.  Chunking and masking  
    Long strings of text or numbers (security codes, phone numbers) are visually chunked or masked.
    
5.  Security practices  
    Security systems reduce need for spontaneous recall by utilizing password best practices, 2-step-authentication, or single sign-on.
    

#### Efficiency

[Fitts’ law, accessibility, memory limitations]

  

1.  Shallow navigation  
    Navigation hierarchy is no more than 3 or 4 levels deep.
    
2.  Responsive layouts  
    Layouts are responsive, or optimized for the screen size of target devices.
    
3.  Size and placement  
    Prominence of targets and content, and design elements corresponds to their relative importance and frequency of use. 
    
4.  Navigation shortcuts  
    Navigation breadcrumbs, progress trackers, and keyboard shortcuts improve findability.
    
5.  Accelerators  
    Autocomplete, auto-detect and other accelerators improve task speed.
    

#### Language

[plain language, literacy, cognitive support]

  

1.  Internal language  
    Branded vocabulary, internal language, and marketing jargon is used sparingly, and absent from navigation, menus, and buttons.
    
2.  Technical jargon  
    Technical or system jargon is absent from error messages and other microcopy.
    
3.  Acronyms  
    Acronyms include access to definitions, and appear in narrative content only.
    
4.  Plain language  
    Technical, legal, and other potentially difficult-to-understand content is written in plain language, unless addressing an expert audience.
    
5.  Readability level  
    Content readability level is appropriate for the target audience(s).
