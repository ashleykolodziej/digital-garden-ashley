# Fitt's Law
This week, you will perform a cognitive task and interpret your results.  

**Fitts' Law**

To begin: Read the instructions below before clicking on the hyperlink. You will see a blank screen with a series of default values. Don’t edit anything, just click start after reading the instructions below.

1.  Perform the Fitts’ Reciprocal Clicking Task: Your task is to click the alternating blue bar as fast and as accurately as possible. It will take less than five minutes - you will receive a notification when the trials are complete. NOTE: These demos work best in Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome browsers! [http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/FittsLaw/FittsLaw.html](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/FittsLaw/FittsLaw.html)
    
2.  Interpret your results. You will see a table of results after you complete your trials. You should only pay attention to the first table labeled “Mean MT.” The columns are labeled with the following information:
    

A = Target distance in pixels; this is the distance from the screen center to the target center in pixels  
W = Target width in pixels; this is the width of the blue bars  
MT = Average movement time in milliseconds  
ID = Index of Difficulty for each width-distance combination  
  
In your post, answer the following questions, keeping in mind that your audience is a non-technical client or stakeholder:   
  

-   What is Fitts' Law in plain language? 
-   How did target distance and target width affect your scores? 
-   Do these findings align with Fitts’ Law? 
-   What type of input device were you using (touchpad, mouse, touchscreen)?  
-   How big was the screen of your device? 
-   How might that have affected your results?

**Reply to a student who hasn't been replied to yet. Provide an example of how you would apply Fitts' Law and Hick's Law in UI design for large screens. Next, go back to your original post, and reply to the student who replied to you. Would these laws apply differently on a smartphone? Why?**

## Fitts' Law Experiment Results (Ashley Kolodziej, Touch Device)

Number of replies: 2

This week, I'll be showing you the results of an experiment I conducted to see if my behavior on an iPad Pro follows Fitts' Law.  

####   

#### What is Fitts' Law?

Fitts' Law is an equation that predicts how long it will take a user to move between two items they interact with, based on the distance between those two items as well as the target item's width (Yablonski, n.d.). It tells us that when distances are longer and the target's width is smaller, we can expect it will take a user a longer time to successfully complete the interaction. In _Mouse Pointers and Fitts's Law,_ Brady Haran (2015) encourages us to think of it like hitting the bullseye on a dartboard. If the dartboard is at arm's length, you can hit the bullseye quickly. If the target is 20 feet away, it'll take much longer, unless you happen to be an expert at dart throwing. If you wanted to compensate for that and reduce the time it takes to hit the target at 20 feet, you could increase the size of the target so that it's as large as an entire wall.

  

  

A potential downside to Fitts' Law is that it only takes into account two dimensions of movement - width, and distance. This complicates the relationship between touch devices and Fitts' Law, since hand position also comes into play when using a touch device (Hoober, 2022). For this experiment, I chose a 12.9 inch iPad Pro, which is what I typically use to do my classwork for this class, to see if Fitts' Law holds up as expected. The task is to hit a blue target on the screen as quickly as possible. You can repeat this experiment at [http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/FittsLaw/FittsLaw.html](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/FittsLaw/FittsLaw.html).

#### Experiment results

This experiment measured combinations of 3 different widths and 3 different distances for a total of 9 combinations of width and distance, and measured the average movement time in milliseconds. The results also provided a difficulty index, which is useful for identifying the theoretical difficulty of each task based on Fitts' Law. In Figure 1 below, I graphed my results to get a better understanding of how width and distance affected average movement time, and if my behavior matched Fitts' Law's expectations.

In this chart, I compared the distance from center of the screen and the width of the target to the average movement time in milliseconds. I was surprised to see that while an increase in distance roughly correlated with an increase in time, there was no meaningful pattern to the width of the target.

---

I was surprised to see that it didn't. Width didn't seem to have a meaningful correlation in my results, which I wasn't expecting since I am on a touch device, and touch interactions tend to be less precise (Hoober, 2022). I expected that a larger touch target would speed up my response time.But in the last three results, an increase in width briefly correlates with an _increase_ movement time, even when distance remained the same in each task.

  

  

Over the course of the experiment, I noticed that in a rush to hit the target, I would miss the target - but the experiment would continue on. I decided to investigate this on my computer. Sure enough, in Figure 2, you can see that when I click off target, the experiment continues. This means that the movement time recorded wasn't the movement time associated with hitting the blue target, but the movement time associated with any tap at all.

In the gif above, I start the test, and then deliberately click several times to the far right of the screen, completely missing the blue target. Notice that the blue target changes position anyway, moving the experiment forward.

---

  

I have two theories for why my results don't match Fitts' Law. One is that when I tapped in the wrong place, the surprise that resulted from breaking my mental model of how this experiment worked caused me to think before tapping subsequent targets. These were likely bigger, since this behavior would have been most noticeable with a small target.  

  

  

My second theory is that my behavior subtly changed for the rest of the experiment once I realized that I could tap outside the blue square. I may have been less concerned with tapping the square precisely in subsequent tasks. I remember realizing this relatively early on. It's possible that a third piece of data, the difference between where I tapped and the target location, would bring important missing context to these results.
