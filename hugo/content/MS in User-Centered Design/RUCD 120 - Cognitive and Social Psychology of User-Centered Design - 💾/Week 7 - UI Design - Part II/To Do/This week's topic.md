### Uxmatters touch pt 1
![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/03/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig3.png)
- Discontinuities in the lines are sensing-precision failures. (The small stylus tip is likely the cause of those, so that issue probably wouldn’t occur with a finger.) The swoops and gaps at the edges are artifacts of the screen’s construction and interference. The waves occur where the calculations between grid lines are a bit off.
- Therefore, unless you’re creating a drawing tool or a game, pretend, for now, that touchscreens don’t detect pressure. While you may find this counterintuitive, it’s important to recognize that the size of the user’s finger is totally irrelevant to touch accuracy and touch sensing.
- Plus, because old touch standards were based on finger size, they’re no longer relevant.
- Any standard that uses pixels instead of physical dimensions is useless because even device-independent pixels vary a lot from screen to screen, and they bear no relationship to human dimensions.
- The W3C more or less ignores mobile devices, especially when it comes to accessibility standards. Their standards define pixel sizes using the old 72/96 ppi (pixels per inch) standard and make no reference to viewing angles, glare, distance, or other issues with which mobile users must contend.

**Incorrect thumb chart**
![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/03/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig5.png)
- believe all taps should be at the bottom of the screen, and that no one can reach the upper-left corner of the screen.
- However, when I do field research, I see people use the Back button all the time. In fact, it’s usually the most-used button on the screen, even when it’s in the upper-right corner.
- The ability to bend the thumb is important because, while the thumb’s free range of movement is in three-dimensional space, touchscreens are flat. Therefore, only a limited portion of the thumb’s range of movement maps onto the phone’s single-axis screen.
- The thumb is the hand’s strongest digit, so using the thumb to tap means holding the handset with the weaker fingers. People realize this, so in the real world, where they may encounter or even expect jostling or vibration, they tend to _cradle_ their mobile device, using one hand to hold it and securing the device with their non-tapping thumb.
- People hold their phone in many ways, while shifting their hold a lot.

![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/03/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig7.png)

**Here are my fundamental findings:**
-   People hold phones in multiple ways, depending on their device, their needs, and their context.
-   They change their methods of grasping their phone without realizing it, which also means people cannot observe themselves well enough to predict this behavior.
-   75% of users touch the screen only with one thumb.
-   Fewer than 50% of users hold their phone with one hand.
-   36% of users cradle their phone, using their second hand for both greater reach and stability.
-   10% of users hold their phone in one hand and tap with a finger of the other hand.

There are other methods of holding mobile phones, using devices that users have set on surfaces, differences in methods for using tablets, and behaviors that adapt depending on what else the user is doing—in life or on the screen.

Perhaps the most surprising and most critical observation I’ve made is that, on mobile touch devices people do not scan from the upper left to the lower right as on the desktop. Nor do they touch the screen in the opposite direction—from the lower right to the upper left—because of the limitations of their thumb’s reach. Instead, as Figure 8 shows, they prefer to view and touch the center of the screen. Figure 8 shows touch accuracy for the various parts of a mobile phone’s or tablet’s screen.

People can read content best at the center of the screen and often scroll content to bring the part they’re reading to the middle of the screen if they can. People are better at tapping at the center of the screen, so touch targets there can be smaller—as small as 7 millimeters, while corner target sizes must be about 12 millimeters.

People never tap precisely where they mean to. There is always inaccuracy.

Target sizes can never be perfect, so record all taps. Misses are on a continuum with no end, so just pick a rate and go with it. All of my suggested target sizes contain only 95% of all observed taps.

### We should use first click testing to measure the usability of tap targets on mobile devices.

### UXmatters touch pt 2
1.  Device diversity is human diversity.
2.  People touch the center of the screen.
3.  People look at the center of the screen.
4.  Fingers get in the way.
5.  People use different devices in different ways.

People hold their phone in multiple ways that change all the time. They don’t have just a single favorite way, but frequently shift their grip. The more I watch people, the more I am amazed at how variable people’s interactions are and how comfortable they are with changing their hand positions.

![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/05/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig2.png)

people shift their grip when typing, and 41% of users hold their phone with both hands and tap using their thumbs when typing.

Regardless of the type of touchscreen device, people prefer to touch the center of the screen.

-   Users prefer to touch the center of the screen and will do so whenever you give them that choice.
-   Place key actions in the middle half to two-thirds of the screen. Then, place secondary options and buttons that provide paths to secondary screens along the top and bottom of the screen

People prefer to view content in the center of the screen. Plus, they notice content in the middle of the screen more quickly and read it more accurately.

When designing content that scrolls or takes up the whole viewport, be sure to pad the bottom of article pages and forms, so users can bring the very last line of text or the last field to the middle of the screen.

Avoid the trendy approach of displaying pages that fit the viewport, then snap to the next page when users swipe. We now know people that don’t enjoy reading like that.

![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/05/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig4.png)

When tapping, people’s finger or thumb completely covers very small icons—such as the Twitter **Retweet** icon shown in Figure 4.

When users cannot see targets, it is impossible to target them well. Users cannot tell whether they’ve successfully tapped a too-small target until they’ve moved their finger or thumb away from it.

**Scrolling position varies by content**
![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/05/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig5.png)

When the content extends across the full width of the screen, more people gesture at the side to scroll. So, even though they tap content such as text labels and icons, they scroll by tapping to the side of the content. When you completely fill a page—for example, with a grid of images—people generally scroll at the far right, trying to get away from the content as much as possible.

when using tablets, people more often scroll nearer to the center of the screen rather than at the edges.

-   Make sure people’s fingers and thumbs don’t obscure content, so they can see what they’re tapping.
-   Make sure selectable items are large enough that they can clearly indicate a successful tap. Try to place functions or any content that changes state to allow users to see the result. Place functions in such a way as to invite users to perform the actions you think are important.
-   Ensure there is plenty of whitespace within the content, as well as reasonable margins, so users can feel confident about scrolling or gesturing in an area that’s separate from any selectable content.

![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/05/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig6.png)

People also use larger devices sitting down more, so almost two-thirds of the time, they use tablets on a stand or resting on a table or in their lap. Figure 7 shows a summary of these behaviors.

![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/05/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig7.png)

In general, the smaller a device is, the more people use it on the move. But on the move doesn’t necessarily mean on a bus or train or walking down a street. It often means simply walking around the house or office.

### Part 3
-   Touch is imprecise.
-   One, two, three for better mobile design.
-   People tap only what they see.
-   Phones are not flat.
-   Work at human scale.

- R95 _Circular Error of Probability_, or the radius containing 95% of all taps.
- real users work with touch user interfaces in the real world.
-   Make touch targets as large as possible, making entire containers such as rows, boxes, and buttons targets, _not_ just icons or words.
-   Don’t just design in the little details or retrofit touch design onto an interface. Make your designs touch centric at the grid and template level, providing enough room and the right kind of interactivity.

If interference between touch targets is likely, design to avoid catastrophic actions. For example, never place email formatting controls right next to the **Send** button. A send is unrecoverable. Make sure the buttons that trigger unrecoverable actions are not very near to anything else the user routinely uses or might easily hit by accident.

-   Design by zones, spacing tappable items to prevent interference according to how well people can touch certain parts of the screen.
-   Touch accuracy differs depending on the area of the screen. Touching the sides of the screen is less accurate than touching the center, so for lists, either avoid placing actions such as delete or select along the left or right side of the screen or make each item in the list tall enough to accommodate edge tap targets.
-   When you place controls along the top or bottom of the screen, provide as few items as possible and give them adequate space. The Android Action Button spacing is too tight, so loosen it up. Placing more than four items on an iOS menu bar—or five on the largest phones—is just asking for trouble.
-   Remember to plan for interference, and place items that either trigger dangerous, unrecoverable actions or display annoying, hard-to-exit elements far from other items or provide the ability to undo these actions.

The most expected controls are those that are visible and communicate what they will do.

For inline links within the content on Web pages, underlines are fine. However, for applications—whether mobile or Web interfaces—you should usually _bound_, or box, tappable items.

-   selectable rows with arrows to the right—These items load other pages or more details.
-   underlined text—These items load additional, helpful information inline.
-   buttons—These submit data or change state.

Visual targets—whether they are text, icons, shapes, or any other type of user-interface widget—must do the following:

-   Attract the user’s eye.
-   Be represented visually so the user understands that they are tappable elements.
-   Be legible, so the user understands what action they will perform.
-   Be large and clear enough so the user can easily and confidently tap them. Follow the size rules for each device class that I provided in Table 1, in [Part 2](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/05/design-for-fingers-touch-and-people-part-2.php "Part 2") of this series.

People shift the way they hold and touch their devices depending on their context.
-   opening a door
-   carrying groceries
-   carrying a baby
-   walking down the street
-   walking in difficult terrain or stepping off a curb
-   riding on a train or bus, especially when standing
-   in a dangerous context—such as when walking in the wind, near water, or near a drop-off

simply carrying a bag in one hand and using the phone with the other can greatly reduce touch accuracy in the most distant corner of the screen—to over 30mm

![](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/07/images/Hoober-Touch-Fig4.png)

The raised bezels on some phones—or the similar effect that results from the cases people often use for their phones—make it difficult to tap targets at the edge of the screen.

-   Avoid getting too close to the boundaries of any touch-target size requirements. Think about worst cases as well.
-   Plan for different contexts, and try out your designs in difficult environments to make sure they work well in the real world.
-   If you need to place items right against the edges of the screen or use edge gestures, go ahead. But provide some padding, so they’ll work even with cases and curved screens.

The best way to handle sizes on mobile devices is to keep your actual hands on your designs. Sketch on paper, using stencils at the scale of actual phones and tablets.

-   Get off your computer and try out your designs on real devices, as soon and as often as possible.
-   Get away from using PowerPoint presentations and, instead, display your designs on real devices to get approval.
-   To account for under-sized scaling, bad environments, and users with poor eyesight, always design everything about 20% larger than you otherwise would.

-   Place content and functions in the middle of the screen.
-   Design with fingers in mind, so users can see around them.
-   Design for zones, with bigger touch targets along the edges and at the corners of the screen.
-   Place touch targets to avoid catastrophes when people miss them.
-   Be consistent in how you design user interfaces and interactions.
-   Always respect people and their device choices, patterns of use, and contexts.
-   Design mobile interfaces at their actual sizes.
-   Try using your designs on real phones.
-   Remember to design for hands, fingers, thumbs, and people.

Always back up your design decisions with data. Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion. All of the information I’ve given you in this series is based on extensive observations of users, often on direct measurements, and research that lets me understand the reasons behind these core concepts and the importance of designing with them in mind.

### Draft
**Initial Post**: Access this week's learning materials on a desktop/laptop and on a mobile device using the Moodle Mobile app.

Describe the differences in your experience.  Which device are you using to respond to this prompt? Why?  

Use your Touch Template to evaluate the Moodle Mobile app. How did it fare in terms of accessibility?

Reflect on what tasks and experiences you tend to access using your laptop or desktop vs. your smartphone or tablet.  Why? When is a mobile experience superior to a laptop experience and vice versa?

---

For this week's post, I evaluated the Moodle website on my desktop computer, the Moodle website on my iPad (a tablet), and the Moodle app on my iPad.

**Typical behavior and experience**
I have used my tablet with the Moodle website for the majority of my work this semester because it is all reading and writing based. My iPad is large enough for me to comfortably type for short to medium periods of time. Since I'm in this program full time, have a full time job, and teach a class, my classwork is usually my downtime. An iPad allows me to curl up under a blanket, relax, and makes it easy for me to pick up and put down my classwork. Because the device is lightweight and usable at the angle my legs naturally sit at, it is always within arms reach to me, and that ease of use helps me keep up with my workload. Sometimes I will start with a rough draft or bulleted notes in my iPad, then go to my computer to refine.

When I need to focus for an extended period of time, or do significant amounts of writing, I prefer my desktop computer. This is also where I work when I work from home, so the physical area is dedicated to focusing and helps me shift my mindset into a flow mindset. When I do significant writing or editing, the precision of a mouse pointer in selecting text is much more helpful to me than my less precise fingers. Citations are also easier for me to manage and edit on my desktop computer through Zotero's website. The downside of my desktop computer is I can only physically and mentally be in that highly focused space so long before I get tired. 

For this prompt, I'm responding using my iPad because it's my weekend morning, and I like feeling like I got to relax. Forum posts are short enough that I can use my iPad comfortably. I can also easily access my reading notes.

### Moodle app
For me, the Moodle app isn't useful at all - not because of the interface design, necessarily, but because it shows me irrelevant information and does not give me access to the tools I actually need to complete my courses. A quick example of what I see when I go to the Moodle app on my iPad:

![[007357E3-1767-4CC4-8FBA-A64B48C9FD63.jpeg]]

It's essentially blank. What I need to complete my coursework is access to my readings and forum posts, but I could not find either of those in the app. 

Checking this interface using the 4ourth Mobile template, touch targets are adequately sized for my screen, have plenty of room around them, and the typography is readable. Main content is in the center of the screen, but takes up the entire screen, leaving no space to confidently scroll (Hoober, 2017), so there is some room for improvement. But what good is even the best designed app if it has no useful information to me?

### Moodle website
I use the website frequently on my tablet, and in my evaluation, found it to mostly follow good mobile design standards. The touch target sizes at the top of the screen could be a bit bigger, and when "Mark as complete" isn't available, sometimes links get too crowded. However, the scroll area is generous with white space and centrally located, which is in line with user preferences on mobile devices (Hoober, 2017). I also thought the accessibility tools to the right were interesting, and mostly worked as expected except for text to speech. On an iPad, it would make more sense to use VoiceOver here anyway.

![[AF69C2FE-ECA4-4D12-B44C-1B8BD16584D5.jpeg]]

Most importantly, I have a clear list of readings, divided by week, and a discussion board link, so I know my exact to do list. Because all of my courses and due dates follow a similar, predictable pattern, I don't need reminders - class is just a part of my routine now. I find calendars and to-do lists with lots of due dates overwhelming, and prefer to take things a day at a time. The primary features and focus of the Moodle app are just plain not designed for me or the type of course I am taking.
