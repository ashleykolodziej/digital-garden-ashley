## Notes
- Emotions, we now know, change the way the human mind solves problemsâ€”the emotional system changes how the cognitive system operates.
- emotions play a critical role in daily lives, helping assess situations as good or bad, safe or dangerous. 
- positive emotions are critical to learning, curiosity, and creative thought
- When you feel good, Isen discovered, you are better at brainstorming, at **examining multiple alternatives**
- Anxiety narrows thought
- attractive things make people feel good, which in turn makes them think more creatively. How does that make something easier to use? **by making it easier for people to find solutions to the problems they encounter**

### Three Levels of Processing: Visceral, Behavioral, and Reflective 

- the automatic, prewired layer, called the visceral level
-  part that contains the brain processes that control everyday behavior, known as the behavioral level
- contemplative part of the brain, or the reflective level
- Animals such as lizards operate primarily at the visceral level. This is the level of fixed routines, where the brain analyzes the world and responds
- Dogs and other mammals, however, have a higher level of analysis, the behavioral level, with a complex and powerful brain that can analyze a situation and alter behavior accordingly
- the human brain can think about its own operations. This is the home of reflection, of conscious thought, of the learning of new concepts and generalizations about the world.
