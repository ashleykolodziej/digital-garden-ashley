# Beyond Usability
**Context**: In the past few weeks, we’ve discussed many of the cognitive implications of design decisions. This week, we’re looking at emotions and behavioral responses - it’s not simply enough to design a product that people can use. You must ensure that people enjoy using it. As an added thought experiment this week, can you think of any reasons why we might design something that a user does not enjoy using?

**Initial Post**: Should some products be primarily visceral in appeal, others behavioral, others reflective? How does one trade off the requirements at one level against those of the others? How do visceral pleasures translate into products? Won't the same things that excite one group of people dismay others? Similarly, for the reflective level, wouldn't a deep reflective component be attractive to some and bore or repel others? And, yes, we can all agree that behavioral design is important—nobody is ever against usability—but just how much in the total scheme of things? How does each of the three levels compare in importance with the others?

Once you’ve answered these questions, identify two products that strike a harmonious balance between the three levels of emotional design (in your opinion!)  

**Replies**: Read through your classmates’ posts and identify products that are less emotionally appealing to you. In replies to two of your classmates’ posts, consider the following questions: Do these products spark a different emotional reaction for you (based on your background or experiences)? Could the products be altered in any way to make them more emotionally appealing?

## Draft

I chose the **design of this course** and **my favorite Woodwick candle**, which was the product I used to introduce myself in this class, to examine as my two harmonious examples of the three layers of design in the prompt this week.

- **Should some products be primarily visceral in appeal, others behavioral, others reflective? How does one trade off the requirements at one level against those of the others?** If products are about eliciting emotion or changing behavior, I don't think it's possible to only design for one of these levels. Even my favorite candle, a primarily visceral product in design, relies on a predictable behavioral standard (I know how and where to light it) and brings me into a reflective state because of my personal associations with the visceral aspects of the candle (sound, light, smell). The core feature, crackling of the candle, is visceral, but the designer chose that specific sound because of associations that they hoped the user would share and enjoy. That choice in itself was reflective. 
- Besides that, a requirement of creative thinking and problem solving is reflection on past experiences. Norman (2005) argues that to think creatively, you must be in a positive state of mind. I would argue that part of that is also behavioral - it would be difficult to reflect if you were busy trying to learn a new skill or routine. The way to make a "trade off" in requirements is to design the product for the context it sits in, and allow the context to handle aspects of the design layer the product can't support on its own. The candle does that by creating a calming sound that likely elicits a positive memory for most users. This allows the product to focus on the visceral layer. 
- **How do visceral pleasures translate into products? Won't the same things that excite one group of people dismay others?** As Norman (2005) says, all visceral emotions serve a purpose, including fear, sadness, and anger. A grade in this course is a classic example of something that could excite or dismay a user. This is intentional. Feedback activates the reflective layer to change your behavior and knowledge. By the time we get to graduate school, hopefully our teachers have helped us understand the purpose of a grade and the visceral reaction associated with it, and how to use that reaction as a motivator to keep improving. The feedback I've received has done a good job explaining why the feedback was the way it was, and how to improve next time.
- **Similarly, for the reflective level, wouldn't a deep reflective component be attractive to some and bore or repel others?** In the case of my candle, you're not required to engage with the reflective layer - it's completely optional. In the case of this class, reflection is not optional, so other layers are used to motivate you to work through it. A major component of the design of the reflective layer is forum posts, which require replies. Those replies activate a visceral reaction of curiosity and interest, while the consistency of the replies creates a behavioral expectation of a good feeling that motivates you to reply each week (Dutra, 2020). I've come to really enjoy the forum posts because viscerally, I like when people agree with me (or disagree!) and expand my thought processes, and behaviorally, I have come to expect the good feeling of digging deeper each week, which continues to motivate me.
- **And, yes, we can all agree that behavioral design is important—nobody is ever against usability—but just how much in the total scheme of things? How does each of the three levels compare in importance with the others?** As the last question shows, behavioral design is important to building trust and reliable expectations, which then serve as motivators (Dutra, 2020). I can expect that by the simple action of lighting my candle, I will have a positive visceral reaction. But I think this course really demonstrates that no one level of design is more important or valuable than the other. Without the consistent format of due dates and times across all my courses, I would have to track all that information actively and reduce my capacity to learn. Leveraging behavioral design for due dates allowed me to learn the pattern early on, have that action become automatic, and create more space for the reflective layer, which in turn gives me visceral feedback. All three layers of design are equally important and interconnected in creating effective product experiences.

#### Should some products be primarily visceral in appeal, others behavioral, others reflective? How does one trade off the requirements at one level against those of the others?

If products are about eliciting emotion or changing behavior, I don't think it's possible to only design for one of these levels. Even my favorite candle, a primarily visceral product in design, relies on a predictable behavioral standard (I know how and where to light it) and brings me into a reflective state because of my personal associations with the visceral aspects of the candle (sound, light, smell). The core feature, crackling of the candle, is visceral, but the designer chose that specific sound because of associations that they hoped the user would share and enjoy. That choice in itself was reflective. 

Besides that, a requirement of creative thinking and problem solving is reflection on past experiences. Norman (2005) argues that to think creatively, you must be in a positive state of mind. I would argue that part of that is also behavioral - it would be difficult to reflect if you were busy trying to learn a new skill or routine. The way to make a "trade off" in requirements is to design the product for the context it sits in, and allow the context to handle aspects of the design layer the product can't support on its own. The candle does that by creating a calming sound that likely elicits a positive memory for most users. This allows the product to focus on the visceral layer.

Behavioral design is important to building trust and reliable expectations, which then serve as motivators (Dutra, 2020). I can expect that by the simple action of lighting my candle, I will have a positive visceral reaction. But I think this course really demonstrates that no one level of design is more important or valuable than the other.
