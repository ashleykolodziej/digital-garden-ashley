Where did the collaboration tool/app succeed? What kinds of improvement suggestions would you suggest for the app(s) you tried with your partner(s)?

## Draft
**How can you design a workplace for social belonging?**
One way to create a sense of belonging and genuine connectedness is to focus on directed communication - acts which engage two people via the same subject - over passive observation and connection (Peters et al., 2018). In an office environment, working in the same physical space is an example of passive connection, while a meeting where team members are actively solving a problem together is directed communication. This means that simply "tearing down walls" in a physical manner or "going back to the office" without any particular plan in place is not sufficient for revitalizing collaboration and social belonging. In fact, when opportunities for directed communication were not planned for, open offices were observed to lead to 70% fewer face to face interactions (Bernstein & Waber, 2019). 

A common theme in my interviews so far has been that interviewees tend to recall face-to-face connections as being the primary way they created a sense of connectedness and belonging at work, even when working in hybrid environments. Digging a bit further, these critical interactions all sparked from a common object nearby to discuss, a common problem to solve, or the discussion of a shared experience. Notably, the subjects of each interaction were personally important to each interviewee, meaning the interaction fostered *both* relatedness and autonomy (Peters et al., 2018). Although my interviewees focused on face to face interactions, any type of workplace can foster interactions which satisfy both relatedness and autonomy by connecting team members with projects which are personally fulfilling to each team member, encouraging sharing of personal goals, interests, and values, and creating spaces with enough change over time to encourage conversation on a regular basis.

**What can you do to design effective and engaging meetings?**
Meetings are a great opportunity to satisfy the need for competence by acknowledging the contributions of those who are speaking up, actively listening, and then asking follow up questions (Peters et al., 2018). They're also a natural form of directed communication. Relatedness could be increased by sending a meeting agenda and materials ahead of time so everyone is prepared with the same information, which allows for more autonomy in reacting to the meeting information and providing individual ideas in the meeting. You could increase autonomy and competence even further by deliberately making space for quieter folks in the room to speak, and inviting them into the conversation when you know they have expertise in the subject you're discussing.

**How is the challenge of designing for engagement different for offices vs. remote work?**
I think the support tools you have to offer in physical spaces versus digital spaces are very different. For example, to create a calm and focused physical space, you might find a room with windows, furnish it with small tables and comfy chairs to encourage small group connections, and have plant life for fresh air. To create a calm and focused digital space, you might write a how-to guide to reduce Slack notifications, or recommend an app to help reduce distractions. In both cases, you provide the tools to create calm, but the tools themselves are very different and the implementation is different as well.

**Kumospace Summary**
Rachel and I tried Kumospace and overall, were impressed. Kumospace is a digital meeting room which mimics a physical space by placing digital furniture, decorations, and activities throughout the space, and allows for real-time streaming of video and audio to make conversation more fluid.

**What worked well:**
- There are lots of autonomy-building opportunities in the space, such as picking a favorite "drink" to carry with your avatar. A nice touch is that the drink slowly depletes over time.
- Kumospace rooms can be highly customized and mimic physical spaces, which creates good potential to make spaces which foster directed conversation.
- Moving between spaces and conversations was intuitive, and the spatial audio feature made it easy to join and focus on one conversation or another - much more so than Zoom breakout rooms.

**What could be improved**
- The audio doesn't filter out computer or background noise well, so when I played a Spotify jukebox in the room, the music piped back through my mic, which was distracting.
- It's not clear what sending to "nearby" means in the chat feature, so using that feature felt risky. We both also accidentally clicked away from our conversation mid-sentence and left the spatial audio radius while seeing what the room had to offer, which led to some awkwardness and repeating.
- Anyone can join a spatial audio radius, and I noticed that when I was in deep conversation with Rachel later on that the Kumospace window wasn't my main focus anymore. In a physical room, others would have visual cues from my body language that I'm in a deep conversation with someone, but you can't really see that with Kumospace. Similarly, if I'm focused on another window or the conversation, I wouldn't be able to see that someone has joined, and welcome them into the conversation or change the subject if I needed to. It might be difficult for me to have a deep conversation in this space if there are many people in the room who could join my conversation without warning at any time.

## Checklist
![[Discussion Rubric]]

In other words, **if you increase autonomy then engagement will improve**,
**if you increase competence then motivation will increase**, and **if
you increase relatedness then wellbeing will be enhanced**–these
needs become the controllers we tweak and adjust to iterate on
and improve experience.

- Autonomy (feeling agency, acting in accordance with one’s goals and values),
- Competence (feeling able and effective),
- Relatedness (feeling connected to others, a sense of belonging)

Devices that offer options and choices over use, and do not in turn
demand actions from users without their assent, enhance feelings
of autonomy         

         Personalization also creates a sense of ownership
and choice beneficial to autonomy         

       For example, assistive
technologies, productivity tools or health management apps, can
all increase autonomy in relation to daily behaviors.

A few screenshots to give you an idea:

I don’t know if I would use this tool all the time, but I think it could be a fun and creative option for occasional parties or learning events that is inclusive of remote folks, or just to play around with. I’m considering making a ridiculous rabbit-themed room to share with my team.
