# Discussion - Defining Information Architecture and IA in Larger Contexts
**Question 1: Determine your own definition of Information Architecture.**
After you’ve done your reading in Information Architecture: For the Web and Beyond for this week, formulate your own definition of what Information Architecture is. Feel free to incorporate sources outside of your assigned readings (be sure to fully cite if you do).

**Question 2: Looking at Information Architecture in larger contexts (Article readings).**
In addition to your readings in Information Architecture this week, you also had three articles to read. Talk about why you think these three pieces were included as part of an introduction to IA. Did anything resonate in particular with you?

## Final 2

I could definitely see a trend in this week's readings in that every one addressed a necessary component or side effect of an information system that was missed because it was outside the framing of some sort of "ideal".

**My Year Was Tragic. Facebook Ambushed Me With a Painful Reminder.**
This was a heartbreaking article to read, and reminded me of the importance of context in the presentation of information, especially invisible context and events outside the systems we plan for. From an information architecture perspective, as Meyer (2014) says, his situation wasn't the "ideal" scenario - and framing the presentation of the content of his past year of life events around the assumption that all moments in the past would still bring joy to him in the present caused serious harm. My biggest takeaway from this article was to not solve assumptions by trying to teach a computer or system to make the judgement, but to ask the user directly what information they want and need instead. 

**Privacy is UX**
Schmidt (2015) argues in this article that the "ideal" data-driven process for a business can lead to unintended harms for users related to privacy and tracking. To me, it highlighted the impacts of how content and information is presented, shared, managed, and stored to the end user of a product. Understanding and planning for how content is presented, managed, and stored is squarely in the realm of information architecture (Rosenfeld et al., 2015), but I've never thought about that beyond content management systems and governance, which are usually more focused on stakeholders.

What struck me most while reading this article was the realization that information architecture has overlap in how analytics can be performed. Just as it's possible to make information easier to track and parse by creating consistent patterns and adding metadata to organize it, I realized it also may be possible to deliberately obscure content by omitting information and metadata or making it more difficult to parse. The question protocol for forms that Schmidt (2015) proposes might also be a good framework for limiting the types of interactions analytics track, or even making content creators' lives easier by limiting the amount of metadata assigned to content to only those pieces and structures which are truly necessary.

**Chapter 1: A Web for Everyone**

This article focused heavily on accessibility and inclusive design. I'm very familiar with the POUR acronym and how closely tied it is to content management and maintenance, so I wasn't surprised to see this reading. Things like headings, alt text, and the like are critical to accessibility, but are also the domain of content creators - and information architecture guides that content creation by setting up structures, standards, and organizational schemes. 

Every once in a while, one of the writers I work with will encounter a researcher or dean who insists on dense, difficult to read content because "they want to attract a certain audience". Knowing what I know now about neurodiversity, and in reading this article, I think an information architect's responsibility is to question this line of thinking when they see it. Deliberately choosing a complex writing style for key content could be keeping well-qualified students with learning disabilities outside of these programs and have other unintended consequences. The definition of disability as "a conflict between someone’s functional capability and the world we have constructed" (Horton & Quesenbery, 2013) especially stuck me in how it shifts the burden from the user to the designer of the system.

## Final 1
I settled on this definition of information architecture:

Information architecture is the act of establishing the system of rules, logic, and structures a person needs to create and refine a mental model of a particular set of information, and planning for what should happen to the system's elements as information evolves. 

A few things that stood out for me in the readings were the ideas of semantics, the influence of context on understanding, and the examples of chess and Disneyland. In the Disneyland example, lands are used as the central structure and as a metaphor to help people understand what a pile of information (theme parks) is and how it might work, while the website uses an existing mental model of travel industry information architectures to help a visitor understand that the website's pile of information will help them achieve the goal of planning a trip (Rosenfeld et al., 2015). Since mental models are derived from experience (Lidwell et al., 2010), I felt that was a good way of acknowledging the influence of context and user expectations succinctly.

I also wanted to make sure consistency, adaptability, and room for growth were represented, so I added an element of planning to my definition. When is a new structure justified? Is it okay for some rules to be malleable? If a label is changed, does that change the perceived logic of what choices are available? Information architecture doesn't have to anticipate every possibility, but I think as this week's reading says, great information architectures plan for the future and likely areas of growth.

## Notes


- gives meaning
- through metaphors and established mental models 
- consistency
- and promotes adaptability through the establishment of rules, logic, and patterns


**Question 1**

From ch 1

"information architecture asks designers to define semantic structures that can be instantiated in multiple ways depending on the needs of different channels" (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

"Digital experiences are new (and very real) types of places made of information; the design challenge lies in making them be coherent across multiple contexts"

Traditionally, many people think of website navigation structures when they think of information architecture, and this view isn’t entirely off: navigation menus and their ilk are certainly within the remit of what information architecture produces. It’s just that you can’t get there without having explored the more abstract territory first.

- Not media or container specific

Ch 2

Let’s start by clarifying what we mean by information architecture:
1. The structural design of shared information environments
2. The synthesis of organization, labeling, search, and navigation
systems within digital, physical, and cross-channel ecosystems
3. The art and science of shaping information products and expe‐
riences to support usability, findability, and understanding
4. An emerging discipline and community of practice focused on
bringing principles of design and architecture to the digital
landscape

No document fully and
accurately represents the intended meaning of its author. No label or
definition totally captures the meaning of a document. And no two
readers experience or understand a particular document or defini‐
tion or label in quite the same way.

**Rules and mechanics of movement or navigation between places and contexts - or relationships?** there are lots of rules that determine how the armies can interact.

These incarnations of chess are all physically very different from one
another, yet they are all still chess. Why? Because they make possible
and express the underlying information structures and rules of
chess.

**Adaptable** the game, its piece types and rules,
its lore, etc. have evolved over centuries. This is also true of the ways
we’ve organized other information structures that afford under‐
standing over time: it’s only in retrospect that we can point to them
and say, “that’s a damned good information architecture!”

Rather, there is a dynamic, organic
nature to both the information systems and the broader contexts in
which they exist.

**Ecosystem?** “information ecology”3 composed of users,
content, and context to address the complex dependencies that exist
in these information environments

Ch 3

**Transformative/adaptive** You don’t really know much about what
you’re looking for, and aren’t ready to commit to retrieving any‐
thing more than just a few useful items, or suggestions of where
to learn more

Ch 4

Building archtecture aims to produce physical environments that
can serve and communicate their social functions effectively, and
information architecture aims to do the same for information envi‐
ronments

information architecture defines compositions of seman‐
tic elements such as navigation labels, section headings, and key‐
words

produces the design principles, goals, and guidelines that
capture the intended feeling of the place (e.g., is this a serious, soli‐
tary place, or a fun, social space?)

**Consistency, patterns** consistent use of language, and by establishing a partic‐
ular relationship, or order, between the linguistic elements that com‐
prise it.

**Room for growth** accommodates organic growth and change 
within a coherent structure

Draws on shared mental models?

We need to be aware of the nature and volume of content that exists
today and how that might change a year from now, and we must
learn about the needs and information-seeking behaviors of our
major audiences.

**Adaptable, malleable** Good information architecture design is informed by all three areas, and all three are moving targets

**Accurately describes information and content in the context of users and the systems surrounding them?**

Your information 
architecture provides perhaps the most tangible snapshot of your 
organization’s mission, vision, values, strategy, and culture.
