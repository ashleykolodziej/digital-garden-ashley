## Notes
- When we use words as labels for our categories, we run the risk that users will miss our meaning
- we also need to agree on which documents to place in which categories
- Classification is particularly difficult when you’re organizing abstract concepts such as subjects, topics, or functions
- Heterogeneity refers to an object or collection of objects composed of unrelated or unlike parts.
- “homogeneous” refers to something composed of similar or identical elements
- heterogeneity - provide access to documents and their components at varying levels of granularity, different content types
- labeling and organization systems are intensely affected by their creators’ perspectives
- To design usable organization systems, we need to escape from our own mental models of content labeling and organization.

## Objective org schemes
- Exact or “**objective**” organization schemes divide information into well-defined and mutually exclusive sections.
- known-item searching. You know what you’re looking for, and it’s obvious where to find it.
- they require users to know the specific name of the resource they are looking for
- **Alphabetical** schemes
- often serves as an umbrella for other organization schemes.

### **Chronological** schemes
- archive of press releases might be organized by the date of release
- complementary combination of organization schemes is often necessary

### **Geographical** schemes
- news and weather that affect us in our location. Political, social, and economic issues are frequently location dependent
- Craigslist

## **Ambiguous** Organization Schemes
- divide information into categories that defy exact definition
- difficult to design and maintain. They can be difficult to use.
- often more important and useful than exact organization schemes
- simple reason why people find ambiguous organization schemes so useful: we don’t always know what we’re looking for
- don’t know the correct label
- may have only a vague information need that you can’t quite articulate
- information seeking is often iterative and interactive
- system helps learn
- groups in intellectual meaningful Way
- supports associative Learning
- more ambiguity but more useful

### **topical** org schemes
- “Newspapers are organized topically, so if you want to see the scores from yesterday’s game, you know to turn to the sports section” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Many people assume that these topical groupings are fixed, when in fact they are cultural constructs that can vary over time.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “most should provide some sort of topical access to content” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “In designing a topical organization scheme, keep in mind that you  are defining the universe of content (both present and future) that  users will expect to find within that area of the system.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

### Task-oriented schemes
- “organize content and applications into collections of processes, functions, or tasks” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “appropriate when it’s possible to anticipate a limited number of high-priority tasks that users will want to perform” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “common in desktop and mobile apps” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “most common in the context of websites where customer interaction takes center stage” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “You will rarely find a website organized solely by task” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “usually embedded within specific subsites or integrated into hybrid task/topic navigation systems” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

### Audience-specific schemes
- “works well if there is value in customizing the content for each audience” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “break a site into smaller, audience-specific mini-sites” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “brings all the promise and peril associated with any form of personalization” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “But what if I’m a science student doing research, and need access to research papers?” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “ambiguous schemes require us to make these educated guesses and revisit them over time” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “can be open or closed” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

#### Open schemes
- “An open scheme will allow members of one audience to access the content intended  
for other audiences” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

#### Closed schemes
“closed scheme will prevent members from moving between audience-specific sections.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

#### Metaphor-driven schemes
- “help users understand the new by relating it to the familiar.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “desktop computer with its folders, "les, and trash can or recycle bin” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “metaphors can help users understand content and function intuitively.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “can be useful while brainstorming, you should use caution when considering a metaphor-driven global organization scheme” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “must be familiar to users” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- **con:** “users might expect a digital library to be staffed by a librarian that will answer reference questions” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “can introduce unwanted baggage or be limiting” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- **Facebook example:** “Initially, the news feed metaphor was apt, because the stream of posts consisted of the latest (chronologically) published friend content.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “introduced a different algorithm for choosing which posts to show first” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “breaking the chronological order that is expected in a news feed” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

#### Hybrid schemes
**Not recommended**
- “Users easily recognize an audience-specific or topical organization” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “small, pure organization schemes can be applied to large amounts of content without sacrificing their integrity or diminishing their usability.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “when you start blending elements of multiple schemes, confusion often follows” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “solutions are rarely scalable” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “hybrid scheme includes elements of  audience-specific, topical, metaphor-based, task-oriented, and  alphabetical organization schemes. Because they are all mixed together, we can’t form a mental model” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “we need to skim through each menu item to find the option we’re looking for.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “exception to these cautions against hybrid schemes exists within the surface layer of navigation” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015) **ie main navigation or homepage**
- “many websites successfully combine topics and tasks on their main page and within their global navigation” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “reflects the reality that both the organization and its users typically identify finding content and completing key tasks at the top of their priority lists” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “shallow hybrid schemes are fine, but deep hybrid schemes are not.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “As long as the schemes are presented separately on the page, they will retain  
the powerful ability to suggest a mental model for users.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

## Organization Structures
- “defines the primary ways in which users can navigate” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “hierarchy, the database-oriented model, and hypertext” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Each organization structure possesses unique strengths and weaknesses. In some cases, it makes sense to use one or the other. In many cases, it makes sense to use all  
three in a complementary manner.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

### Top-Down Approach
- “foundation of many good information architectures” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “We divide books into chapters into sections into paragraphs into sentences into words into letters” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Because of this pervasiveness of hierarchy, users  can easily and quickly understand information environments that use hierarchical organization models” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “able to develop a mental model of the environment’s structure and their location within that structure” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “usually a good place to start the information architecture process” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “allows you to quickly get a handle on the scope of the information environment without  going through an extensive content-inventory process” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “can begin identifying the major content areas” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

#### Designing hierarchies
- “be aware of, but not bound by, the idea that hierarchical categories should be mutually exclusive” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Hierarchies that allow cross-listing are known as polyhierarchical” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Ambiguous organization schemes in particular make it challenging” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “you might place the more ambiguous items into two or more categories so that users are sure to find them.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “if too many items are cross-listed, the hierarchy loses its value” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Topic and format are  simply two different ways of looking at the same information. Or, to use a technical term, they’re two independent facets” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Breadth refers to the number of options” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “consider the balance between breadth and depth in your hierarchy.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “If a hierarchy is too narrow and deep, users have to click or tap through an inordinate number of levels to find what they are looking for” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Depth refers to the number of levels in the hierarchy.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “When considering breadth, you should be sensitive to people’s visual scanning abilities and to the cognitive limits of the human mind” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “the number of links you can safely include is **constrained by users’ abilities to visually  scan the page** rather than by their short-term memories.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Group and structure information at the page level.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Presenting information hierarchically at the page level, as NCI has done, can make a major positive impact on usability.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “In contrast to breadth, **when considering depth, you should be even  more conservative**.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “new information environments that are expected to grow, you should lean toward a broad-and-shallow rather than a narrow-and-deep hierarchy.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “It is less problematic to add items to secondary levels of the hierarchy than to the main page,” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

### The Database Model: A Bottom-Up Approach
- “a collection of data arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval.”” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “In relational database structures, data is stored within a set of relations or tables.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Rows in the tables represent records, and columns represent fields” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Metadata is the primary key that links information architecture to the design of database schemas” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “apply the structure and power of relational databases to the heterogeneous, unstructured environments of websites and intranets” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “tagging documents and other information objects with metadata, we enable powerful searching, browsing, filtering, and dynamic linking” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “The ERD is used to visualize and refine the data model before design and population of the database.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Instead, you need to understand how metadata, controlled vocabularies, and database structures can be used to enable:  
	• Automatic generation of alphabetical indexes (e.g., a product  
	index)  
	• Dynamic presentation of associative “see also” links and content  
	• Fielded searching  
	• Advanced filtering and sorting of search results” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
	
- “particularly useful when applied within relatively homogeneous subsites such as product catalogs and staff directories” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “enterprise controlled vocabularies can often provide a thin horizontal layer” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Deeper vertical vocabularies can then be created for particular departments, subjects, or audiences” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

### Hypertext
- highly nonlinear
- connect text, data, image, video, and audio chunks” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “connected hierarchically, nonhierarchically, or both” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “substantial potential for complexity and user confusion” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “reflect highly personal associations” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “relationships that one person sees between content items may not be apparent to others” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- easy for users to get lost (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “can’t create a mental model of the environment’s organization” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “rarely a good candidate for the primary organization structure” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- good for complementing other models
- allows creative relationships between items and areas in the hierarchy.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

### Social Classification
- Twitter
- user-generated content tagging
- Free tagging, also known as collaborative categorization, mob indexing, and ethnoclassification
- can be informally supported in text fields, or tags can be suggested
- No single person or centralized team created a taxonomy to define these relationships.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- emerged (and continue to emerge) through the tagging efforts of many individuals.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “LinkedIn allows users to “endorse” their professional contacts as possessing certain individual professional skills” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “are in effect tag” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “allow users to describe their business contacts in a granular way that informs how the system groups them with similar people” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “these are not free-form,” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “The passage of time has proven the value of top-down structures: high-profile experiments in tag-driven systems—such as the bookmarking service Delicious.com—fizzled in the marketplace, and most of these systems employed tags within centrally defined structures anyway.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)

## Creating Cohesive Organization Systems
- “first step in transforming data into information is exploring its organization” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “think about the organization structures that influence how users can navigate through these schemes” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
	- “hierarchy,” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
	- “structured database model” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
	- “loose hypertextual web” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “break down the information enviornment into its components” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “all information-retrieval systems work best when applied to **narrow domains** of **homogeneous** content” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Exact schemes are best for known-item searching, when users know precisely what they are looking for” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Ambiguous schemes are best for browsing and associative learning, when users have a vaguely defined information need.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “Whenever possible, use both types of schemes.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
- “large systems typically require several types of structures.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015)
