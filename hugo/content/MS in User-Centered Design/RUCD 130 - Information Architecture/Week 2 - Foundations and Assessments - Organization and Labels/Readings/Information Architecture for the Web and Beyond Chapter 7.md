## Notes

## Labeling
- feedback between labels, users, and content is not immediate, and may not be existent at all
- conversing with systems we design becomes a game of telephone
- need to speak same language as users
- “Labels should educate people about new concepts and help them quickly identify familiar ones.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 3)

“To get a sense of how successful this conversation might be, look at a site’s main page, do your best to ignore the other aspects of its design, and ask yourself a few questions: Do the prominent labels on this page stand out to you? If they do, why? (Often, successful labels are invisible; they don’t get in your way.) If a label is new, unanticipated, or confusing, is there an  explanation? Or are you required to click through to learn more?  
Although unscientific, this label testing exercise will help you get a sense of how the conversation might go with actual users.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 3)

### Disambiguation
- “Menu: Does this refer to the navigation menu of the site? A list of coffee drinks? Or is it a menu in the sense of a restaurant? (It turns out to be the latter.)” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 4)
- “it becomes more problematic when rendered in a  mobile browser, because the label “Menu” is more often experienced in those browsers as a way of accessing the system’s main navigation menu” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 5)
- “Co!eehouse” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 6)
- “a physical place where you can  buy coffee. So you’d think that this is where you will find a list of  Starbucks’s stores, and you’d be partly right... But there is much  more there!” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 6)
- has a particular meaning to Starbucks only
- “because “Coffeehouse” begins with the word “Coffee” (and sits close to it in the navigation menu), this label may cause users to do a double-take when looking for coffee.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 6)
- “poor labeling can destroy a user’s confidence in an organization.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 8)

### Varieties of Labels
- labels can be textual and iconic
- **contextual links** jump links, hyperlinks
- **headings** Labels that describe the content that follows them
- **navigation system choices** Labels representing the options in navigation systems
- **Index terms** Keywords, tags, and subject headings that represent content for searching or browsing
- a label can be one or more of these at once

#### Contextual Links
- “Labels describe the hypertext links” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 9)
- “naturally occur within the descriptive context of their surrounding text.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 9)
- “just because contextual links are relatively easy to create doesn’t mean they necessarily work well” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 9)
- "developed in a ad-hoc manner"
- highly personal, can mean different things to different people
- rely on context
- without the proper context, “the label loses its representational value, and users are more likely to experience occasionally rude surprises.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 9)
- casual use may occur with a writer, expert, blogger. acceptable when there is a high degree of trust.
- “labels are glued together by the copy and context rather than membership in a peer group” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 11)

### Headings as labels
- Establish a hierarchy within content
- hierarchy can help establish meaning to unclear labels

“Yet the game schedule closer to the top of the page doesn’t merit the same treatment, because most readers could visually distinguish these without actually reading them” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 13)

- can also be used to convey sequence, esp w/ numbers
- reframe labels as actions
- use verbs
- should be designed more systematically than link labels

## Nav systems
- demand more consistency due to repetition and smaller number of choices - makes "thing that doesn't match" look a lot more obvious quickly
- common patterns exist and can be applied consistently for easier pattern recognition
- “same label can often represent different kinds of information” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 16)
- ex: news as annoucements, or news as journalism?

## Index terms
- “keywords, tags, descriptive metadata, taxonomies, controlled vocabularies, and thesauri” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 17)
- “describe any type of content” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 17)
- “sites, subsites, pages, content chunks” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 17)
- supports more precise searching than simply searching the full text” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 18)
- “assessed the content’s meaning” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 18)
- “described it using index terms” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 18)
- used to make browsing easier” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 18)
- “serve as the source of browsable lists or menus” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 18)
- “provide an alternative to a primary organization system” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 18)
- cuts across grain of silos
- usually invisible to end user, only relevant when searched
- systematic approach to labeling—using index terms from controlled vocabularies or thesauri—has more value.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 20)
- creates consistency and predictability

### Iconic Labels
- typically found in mobile apps
- more limited than text labels
- suited for smaller systems due to that
- good for children or multiple languages, small spaces
- more difficult to represent meaning
- may require guessing
- adds aesthetic appeal
- “icons are especially useful shorthand, both representational and easy to visually recognize” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 21)
- use iconic labels only for environments with a limited set of options

## Designing Labels
- synonyms, antonyms, and contexts can cause confusion
- ambiguity is a challenge
- labels will never be perfect or understood 100% of time
- remember content, users, and context
- try to narrow scope by focusing on a defined audience
- chunk audiences if required
- “reduce the number of possible perspectives on what a label means” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 22)
- “fewer subject domains achieves more obvious and effective representation” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 22)
- “erring toward simplicity will make your labels more effective.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 22)
- “avoid using labels that address the entire system’s content” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 22)
	- “design more modular, simpler collections of labels to address those specific areas.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 23)
- “separate labeling systems for different areas of your environment” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 23)
- develop **systems,** not individual labels
- **unify**
- creates predictability and is easier to learn
- consider using styleguides
- consider brand guidelines for consistent visual application
- don't forget **syntax**
	- noun-based
	- verb-based
	- question-based
	- pick one and stick with it
- keep the level of granularity similar across labels, roughly equal in specificity

“it’s confusing to encounter a set of labels that cover differing levels of granularity—for example, “Chinese restaurants,” “Restaurants,” “Taquerias,” “Fast Food Franchises,”” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 24)

### Comprehensiveness
- Gaps in a labeling system can trip people up 
- A comprehensive scope helps people scan and infer content more accurately 
- Different audiences may require different labeling systems, even if the content is the same

## Sources of Labeling Systems
- Existing labeling systems might include labels currently on your website, comparable or competitors' sites, etc.
- Study what works and what doesn't in other environments, and apply it to your own.
- Your current website or app probably already has labeling systems by default.
- Walk through the entire system, either manually or automatically, and gather the labels.
- Creating a labeling table is often a natural extension of the content inventory process.
- Arranging labels in a table provides a more condensed, complete, and accurate view of navigation labels as a system.

### Comparable/competitive envs.
- Determine audience needs
- Surf competitor sites
- Label what works and what doesn't

### Controlled vocabularies and thesauri
- Useful resources are created by professionals with library or subject-specific backgrounds
- These resources are often publicly available and have been designed for broad usage
- Controlled vocabularies and thesauri are not available for every domain

**Resouces**
• Taxonomy Warehouse  
• American Online Thesauri and Authority Files

### Creating new systems
- most important sources are your content (and potentially its authors), and the people who will be using your environment.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015, p. 31)

### Content Analysis
- Read a representative sample of your environment's content and jot down a few descriptive keywords for each document. 
- Look for ways to speed up the process by focusing on any existing content representations like titles, summaries, and abstracts. 
- "Entity extraction" applications may get you 80% of the way to the finish line. 
- You need to do a bit of manual labor to make sure the output actually makes sense.

### Content authors
- Ask content authors to suggest labels for their own content.
- Talk to company researchers or PR people.
- Users may not use sufficiently specific labels.
- Find advanced users or user advocates.
- May include reference librarians.
- Use a top-down approach.
- Start with a few groupings.

### Users (directly)
- The actual users of a system are the best source of labeling there is.
- Card sorting is a way to get users to suggest labels.
- There are two basic varieties of card sorts: open and closed.
- Open card sorts allow participants to cluster labels for existing content into their own categories and then label those categories.
- Closed card sorts provide participants with existing categories and ask them to sort content into those categories.
- Free-listing is an even lower-cost way to get users to suggest labels.

### Users (indirectly)
- Analyzing search queries can be a valuable way to tune labeling systems.
- The popularization of free-form tagging in social networks has created a valuable source of data on users’ needs.
- Search log analysis is a great way to understand the types of labels your site’s visitors typically use.
- These are the labels that users utilize to describe their own information needs in their own language.
- Users’ queries use single or multiple terms, which could affect your own choice of short or long labels.
- You may decide to change your labels accordingly, or use a thesaurus-style lookup to connect a user-supplied term to the preferred term.
- Another way to obtain search terms is by using Google AdWords to see what terms people are searching for.
- Tuning and tweaking the list of terms can be done by sorting the list of terms alphabetically, removing duplicates, and reviewing the list for consistency.
- You may also want to determine if the labeling system has obvious gaps and if so, try to anticipate the topics not yet covered.
