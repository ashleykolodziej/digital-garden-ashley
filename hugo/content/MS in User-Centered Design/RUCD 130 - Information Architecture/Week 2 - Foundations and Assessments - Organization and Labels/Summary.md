# Foundations and Assessments: Organization and Labels
**Dates:** Apr 13-19

Starting this week, we’re moving from more general, overarching concepts into specific concepts, tools, and practices. Much of what we do as Information Architecture professionals is to help provide structure. To this end, understanding how hierarchy and organization systems work, and understanding how labels contribute to those systems are essential.
