## Assignment 1 - Sitemap Exercise
For your first three assignments, you will analyze a widely popular site with complex structure to review (please note that you will be working with the same site for your first three exercises, so choose one you feel comfortable spending a lot of time with). 

Analysis is good practice. You will often be asked to examine & evaluate competitors’ work, and the ability to effectively communicate what works well and what could be improved on an existing product is an essential skill. You’ll be able to apply what you learn in these assignments when you are creating your own designs and architectures.   
  
You will be creating a sitemap and will write a brief analysis of the site’s organization and structure.
