# Discussion - Card Sort Exercise and WCAG Standards
**Question 1: Card Sort Exercise**

Use one of the two following methods to do a card sort exercise of the links in the main navigation of the Brandeis GPS Homepage

- [Sign up for a free student MURAL account](https://www.mural.co/education). Then copy & paste the sticky notes from [this MURAL board](https://app.mural.co/t/candrabrandeis5027/m/candrabrandeis5027/1616896303114/161fc783b67df61094f97d316be9b358455c3e49) into your own board for the card sort exercise. Use the stickies to put the links in the order that makes sense to you. Create & label your categories. You may use the same labels that the main site does, or you may create your own labels. You may add, remove, or duplicate any of the links.
	- **OR**
- Make a copy of [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/spreadsheets/d/1chd3VtfrVa63ljgl2M3Tlr73fbXMk2GMUmbLxUYsoz4/edit?usp=sharing) and save it to your own Google Drive. Use the spreadsheet's columns to put the links in the order that makes sense to you. Create & label your categories in the first cell of each column. You may use the same labels that the main site does, or you may create your own labels. You may add, remove, or duplicate any of the links.

After doing your card sort, write your response to participating in the exercise (include a link to a Google Drive file with your results). Have you ever worked with this technique, or was this the first time you’ve used it? How would you incorporate card sorting to help with organization and labels.

In your replies to your classmates, think about differences in your responses. Does anything that you’ve learned in other classes apply? If so, how?
(Note: As a fun comparison, here's a [previous iteration of this exercise](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/19UESGKJYKjNAw6MwApHYCLy_yqfYKXpKiff6lB20fOQ/edit?usp=sharing) in a Google Drawing from the version of the old Brandeis GPS homepage)

**Question 2: Web Standards**
Everyone who works on creating websites should be familiar with the [WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag). These are standards to which web products should be built to make sure that people can access content regardless of how they use the internet (e.g., via use of a touchscreen, a mouse and monitor, screen readers, voice controls, etc.). While many of the guidelines deal with semantic markup for developers, information architects, and web designers, other stakeholders in the process should know and adhere to these guidelines as well. Take a look at [content guideline 1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation),  including the “Understanding” and “How to Meet” links attached to the individual guidelines. Discuss how these guidelines relate to your readings on organization and labels.

## Draft - Question 2
- bottom up ch 5 "Once there, they’ll want to jump to other relevant content on your site without learning how to use its top-down structure.""
- **on hyperlinks as labels** without the proper context, “the label loses its representational value, and users are more likely to experience occasionally rude surprises.” (Rosenfeld et al., 2015) ch 7
- Ch 7 "Yet the game schedule closer to the top of the page doesn’t merit the same treatment, because most readers could visually distinguish these without actually reading them" yes, but this relies on visuals. What about screen readers?
