# Discussion - Cross Channel
**Question 1: Thinking about information architecture across different device types.**

Review an electronic product, site, or service you use on a regular basis (e.g. email, a news site, an instructional platform, etc.). With what kind of device do you primarily access it (e.g. phone, laptop, tablet, etc.)? Look at your choice on a device or platform that has a form factor thatâ€™s different from what you normally use (or, if you use more than one, take a look at it on all of the platforms you use). Are there any differences in navigation or search? What are differences, if any? What do you think of the choices the designers made? Would you make different choices? Why or why not?
