# Personal Metadata
**Question 1: Take a look at the metadata for some of your personal data by using at least one of the options below:**

-   “[What every browser knows about you](http://webkay.robinlinus.com/)”: uses browser info, APIs, and other generally available information
-   Your Google History: [https://history.google.com](https://history.google.com)
-   Your Google Maps Location History: [https://maps.google.com/locationhistory](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory)
-   Your Android Phone Location History: On an Android phone, go to Settings → Location → Google Location History 
-   [How-To-Geek article](https://www.howtogeek.com/437871/how-to-find-your-location-history-on-iphone-or-ipad/) on finding your location data on an iOS device.
-   If you use a health tracker (e.g. Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.), log into your account to look at your data over time, and check your sharing settings to see if you’re sharing your data with other apps

Being only as specific as you’re comfortable with, talk about what you learned. Were you surprised by any of the metadata that you found?
