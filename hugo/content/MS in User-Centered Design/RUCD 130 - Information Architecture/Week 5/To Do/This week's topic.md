# Title
**Question 1: Take a look at** [https://analytics.usa.gov/](https://analytics.usa.gov/). Drawing upon your reading for this week, how might you use this data as an Information Architect?

## Draft
As an information architect, these analytics can provide me with a more complete understanding of how users are interacting with government websites, including different devices they might be using, what content is most useful or popular, and which pages users may be leaving the site from (Rosenfeld et al., 2015). Since I work at a university, I found the Department of Education analytics at https://analytics.usa.gov/education/ to be especially interesting, and a potential good source for benchmarking data for my own use. This section of the analytics tracks FAFSA and other student aid, which is a critical part of the admissions and aid process for many students at Boston University. Seeing top pages and downloads can help me more quickly uncover what information I might need to link to from our own admissions and aid pages. The quick overview of popular page titles also allows me to quickly evaluate whether the language we use at Boston University is consistent with the language on studentaid.gov. It's also interesting to be able to see the languages of students navigating studentaid.gov, and compare that to our own admissions and aid analytics. Using these analytics as a benchmark could help us investigate if there are any differences in behavior and usage of our websites among non-native English speakers, and find ways to support them.

One thing I am wary of is the sample size of this data, and how it skews percentages. Because of the relatively small sample for real time analytics, the percentage of visitors from the United States has been fluctuating anywhere from 11-38% as I've refreshed the page. Given the real-time nature, it's also important to consider the timing of looking at this page. For example, because it is 12am EST, it's possible the percentage of international visitors is significantly skewed because many students in the US may be asleep.


**Question 2: Take a look at the main site of an analytics platform—either one of the ones listed below or one you find yourself.**

-   Google Analytics: [https://www.google.com/analytics/](https://www.google.com/analytics/)
-   Matomo: [https://matomo.org/](https://matomo.org/)
-   Adobe Analytics: [http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html](http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html)

(If you choose to look at another, include the name of the platform and a link to the main site)

How would you describe the platform? Who is the audience for that platform? What kinds of information does the platform provide? Thinking about your final project, would the platform be appropriate for what you’re working on?

## Draft
I chose to look at Matomo, and I can tell immediately that their differentiating factor is their focus on privacy from the hero headline at the top of the page. Between that, the fact that they're calling out multiple countries below the hero image as being trusted customers, a custom-written GDPR guide call to action, and the dedicated On-Premise navigation item, it's clear to me they are targeting large businesses which operate in multiple countries, have to comply with GDPR laws, and have the IT support structure to run a dedicated analytics solution on their own servers. I can also see a secondary audience for this being developers in general, as I know many developers are passionate about having full control of their data, privacy, and supporting open source software. If I had to sum it up, I would say Matomo is a less intrusive and more privacy-focused analytics option than major competitors such as Google or Adobe.

I was interested to find out that although it's not a focus of the homepage, Matomo offers many of the features I use in Google Analytics, plus a few bonuses such as heatmaps and session recordings. I'm planning to create a gardening-themed, collaborative poetry game for my final project, and session recordings, custom events, and funnels would be helpful ways to see how people are interacting with different elements of the game and tweak things like sprout time to keep them engaged while maintaining a challenge. I'm familiar enough with setting up software like this from WordPress that I'm comfortable setting up and installing this on a server, so although I'm not necessarily their target audience, I think it'd be a fine enough fit for what I want to do with plenty of room to grow. I'd strongly consider using it after researching a bit more into Google's game-focused analytics, which have some gaming-specific metrics such as play time (_[GA4] Games Reports - Analytics Help_, n.d.), to see if I really need to make the privacy trade off to get the data I need.
