# Question 1
**Question 1: Explore overlapping Information Architecture and Content Strategy deliverables.  
**In previous sessions of this course, we've read Erin Kissane's T[he Elements of Content Strategy](http://elements-of-content-strategy.abookapart.com/), one of the first books to define the discipline. Content Strategy and related sub-disciplines have evolved a lot since it was published, but much of the information from the book still holds true. As part of her overview of the field, Kissane lists a number of content strategy deliverables including the following:

-   CMS requirements
-   Community moderation policies
-   Content production workshops
-   Content sourcing plans
-   Content style guides
-   Content templates
-   Editorial calendars
-   Example content
-   Feature descriptions
-   Gap analyses

-   Metadata recommendations
-   Publishing workflow
-   Qualitative content audit and findings
-   Quantitative content audit and findings
-   Resource review (people, tools, time)
-   Search-engine optimization reviews
-   Success metrics
-   User scenarios
-   Visual presentation recommendations
-   Workflow recommendations

Many of these are also Information Architecture deliverables or activities. While we'll be looking more closely at design documentation in Week 8, review this list and investigate something you're either not familiar with or want to learn more about. Thinking about possible content needs for your final project, how might you use the item you chose to communicate information to your stakeholders?

## Draft
I chose to investigate community moderation policies since my final project includes written content which can be shared from user to user. One of the first ideas I encountered that I'd never really thought of is that community (and by extension, content) moderation policies don’t solely exist to keep particular words out of the content, or create a safe space to participate in - it can also be more broadly about achieving the community's goals (Davis, 2020). Davis cites GitHub as a great example of community guidelines, and as I was reading through them, a few things that stuck out to me especially were how it set up the goals of the community and purpose of its existence, what behaviors support those goals, and clear processes for what happens when those guidelines are violated, and how to appeal them (GitHub, n.d.). I like that the justification of content moderation in a community moderation policy goes back to the app or stakeholder goals, and I think that’s valuable to be transparent about for both stakeholders and users.  
  
For stakeholders of any website or app which fosters user interaction, I would strongly recommend writing and maintaining a clear community and content moderation policy after reading this. Not only is it critical to be clear on behaviors and processes for unsafe behavior to create safe spaces to interact - our reading on Usability.gov reminded me that staffing decisions are often affected by content (U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Technology Transformation Service, 2016). My stakeholders would need to know how my ideas are affecting their own staff and if additional staff are needed to carry out the design in a manner that is safe and enjoyable for all users, and clearly outlining community moderation policies helps make that need more tangible with a clear task list and steps the moderator is responsible for enacting.

## Question 2
Question 2: Looking at forms as an area where Information Architecture and Content Strategy overlap.  

Form design is an important area in which information architecture, content strategy, interaction design, and visual design all overlap. “How to Report Errors In Forms: 10 Guidelines ( [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/errors-forms-design-guidelines/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/errors-forms-design-guidelines/) )” is an article on form usability with an accompanying video from the Neilsen Norman Group (2019). Taking this article and any other sources into account, what role does information architecture play in designing forms? If you were working as an IA, how would you work with a Content Strategist in approaching form design?

## Draft
I saw many ways that forms interact with information architecture in Krause's (2019) article, but one that immediately jumped out to me because of our past forum discussions was the relationship between forms and how personal information is sent, received, and stored. A common best practice in mobile UX design is to not ask a user for something until you really need it, and once you do, to explain why you need the information and how you intend to use it (Babich, 2020). As an information architect working with a content strategist, I could ask them what information they intend to collect in the form, why, and see if any of it can be reduced or clarified for a more streamlined user experience with minimal data collection.

The example password strength indicator also reminded me of our readings on placemaking as a navigation tool, and how it can help users gain confidence and find information more quickly (Rosenfeld et al., 2015). When I saw the indicators change in real time, it truly felt like following an information scent or breadcrumbs to the ideal data the interface wanted from the user. Working with a content strategist, I think it would be beneficial to ask what ideal responses look like to them, and then as an information architect, I could design validation steps to encourage that. For example, if a content strategist wanted a minimum amount and quality of content for a review website, I could design form validation in the review input to encourage users if they pause while typing to keep going, and maybe suggest an idea for what to put in the review to give them a hint to get to the right place.
