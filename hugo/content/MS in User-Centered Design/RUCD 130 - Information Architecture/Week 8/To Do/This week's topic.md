# Wireframes vs Prototypes
**Question 1: Think through how and when to use two important kinds of Information Architecture deliverables.  
**

This week, we’re focusing on creating wireframes; however, in many cases, interactive prototypes are preferred over or in addition to wireframes. Sometimes these prototypes will be a part of a process that includes wireframes; sometimes they may be in lieu of wireframes altogether, especially when working in an Agile or Lean workflow.

There’s a lot out there in the User-Centered Design community that takes a position on this issue. Do some research on this topic (look at industry sources like UX magazines, blogs, etc. and at academic sources like journal articles and conference proceedings), then write about some of the pros and cons of prototyping and wireframing, especially thinking about things from an Information Architecture point of view (as opposed to that of an Interaction Designer, for example). Do you have any experience on this issue from your own career? If so, what’s your position? As always, be sure to cite any sources you consult for your reply

## Draft
I work in the industry, so I definitely have an opinion on this - all my wireframes tend to lean towards simple prototypes, at least for basic functionality, and the reason why is because prototypes are really good at clarifying intentions and kicking assumptions out the door for key pieces of functionality and content flows. In fact, I don't even think of clickable wireframes the way I do them as prototypes - they're something in the middle. I was interested to see UX Matters take the position that wireframes and prototypes are really a spectrum you can land anywhere in depending on project and needs (Lepore, 2010), since that has been my experience working on a number of different projects over the years. The tools we have access to now, in comparison with what I learned in undergrad, really blur the lines between each deliverable. At my work, we have a set of design patterns and functionality we share amongst projects, and more recently, we've really been investing in that. Technically speaking, the purpose of wireframes is to communicate content priority, hierarchy, and functionality (Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, 2013). If you already have that product built and know it's the best choice for the project due to budget constraints or a common pattern you've already researched, you can't get much closer to the goal of wireframes more quickly than standing up a quick sandbox site with the real content applied to the product. Sometimes I'll even do this when quoting to keep things speedy and estimate more accurately.

I also find a lot of benefit in presenting wireframes with some basic click interactions in place because it makes my wireframe presentations go more smoothly. Instead of miming an interaction during a presentation (I had to do this for years before tools like Figma and XD came about), I can show it in real time, and it is much clearer to the client and the team.

You would think that with this experience, I would eschew wireframes in my process altogether, but I actually have found some problems with going with prototypes only. One significant problem is that unless the prototype has real data and everyone is clear on where the data comes from and how to edit it, it's easy to miss the details of how data and content will be entered in a prototype. There are lots of little screens to click around, and if you annotate each one, all your annotations can quickly be spread across separate screens. Even if your software can collect all these annotations into a single place, the visuals often get disconnected when this happens, and those provide important context which makes annotations difficult to understand on their own. I work with WordPress sites, so the bulk of the data entry is already determined by that system and our web editors know basics of how to edit sites. But things like data source and entry really can't be prototyped easily, and that's where wireframes and technical diagrams shine. For example, I did this diagram yesterday for a project I'm working on now where at a casual glance, the information looks holistic, but from a business perspective, we want to separate recurring, non-promotional events from events which affect facility usage that someone might want to attend at our student gym.

I use a good mix of both types of tools project by project, depending on the needs of what we're building and the client and team's level of technical understanding. Last time I had a project with this type of content and functionality complexity, I created a written technical spec because the team I was on preferred that type of documentation. But I would say that all these deliverables are related to the main goal of defining functionality and content relationships and entry in my mind, and which one to use is really dependent on what I'm trying to communicate and why.
