## Professor's notes
Welcome to Week 1, Researchers! And yes, if you’re enrolled in this class you’re now a researcher. 

To get us started, we will do a deep dive into ethics as this should be one of our top priorities in any research endeavors we engage in. 

Week One Objectives

By the end of week one, you will be able to:

-   Understand basics of user research methods  
    
-   Have a solid understanding of the need for ethical considerations in research including accessibility needs
-   Be able to craft an informed consent document paying special attention to data management, protection, and privacy
