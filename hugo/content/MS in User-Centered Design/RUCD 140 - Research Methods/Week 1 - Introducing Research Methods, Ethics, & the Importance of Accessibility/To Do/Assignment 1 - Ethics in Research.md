## Assignment 1: Ethics in Research
(Independent Assignment) This is an independent assignment meant to be completed by students individually. You will create and submit your own Informed Consent document based on the Brandeis templates. One document will be created and turned in by Tuesday.  

While we are not submitting work for IRB (Institutional Review Board) as our research is conducted for educational purposes to provide training in how to perform these methods, we will utilize the Brandeis Informed Consent Form as a template to build our own.   

Please review the following links:

-   Brandeis Informed Consent Form Template [https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/compliance/irb/docs/informedconsenttemplate.pdf](https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/compliance/irb/docs/informedconsenttemplate.pdf)
-   Brandeis Elements of Informed Consent: [https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/compliance/irb/docs/elementsofic.pdf](https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/compliance/irb/docs/elementsofic.pdf)

Based on these documents, create your own document for a hypothetical research study utilizing the same document questions and providing similar answers. You do not need to include the letterhead or the final paragraph starting with “This research was approved by the office/committee…”.

As you are filling out this document, you will find the section titled: **“How will your information be kept private?**” 

Please review the following links for details on how to fill out this section:

-   Brandeis Data Management and Protection [https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/compliance/irb/Data%20Management%20and%20Protection.html](https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/compliance/irb/Data%20Management%20and%20Protection.html)
-   Brandeis Guide to Data Management and Protection [https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/compliance/irb/docs/datamanagement.pdf](https://www.brandeis.edu/ora/compliance/irb/docs/datamanagement.pdf)

Based on the information you find on these links, craft a concise statement that you would provide to a participant on how you will handle their personal identifiable information as well as any data you collect from them during the course of the study. For the purposes of this document, consider your study a Level I Risk Level. 

**This assignment is due Tuesday at 11:59 pm ET.** 

**Turning it in:**  
We will use a similar naming convention throughout the entire semester. When you turn in your assignment it should start with the Week number (W01) then your last name (Hubbard) and then a dash followed by the name of the assignment. So, for this week our naming convention would be: W01LastName-InformedConsent and it would look like W01Hubbard-InformedConsent if I were to turn it in. We will do the same when we turn in our group work where the Last Name will be replaced by Group Name.  

**Please use Google Docs to submit your assignment. Include a link to the Google doc in your submission and any comments you have for me. Be sure to have the share settings in Google Docs to allow for comments.  
**

When you turn your assignment in for this week, please title your informed consent accordingly:   
W01LastName-InformedConsent
