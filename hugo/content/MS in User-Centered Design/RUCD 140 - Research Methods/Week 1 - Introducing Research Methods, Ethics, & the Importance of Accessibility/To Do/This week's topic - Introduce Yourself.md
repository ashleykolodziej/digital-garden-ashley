# Introduce Yourself
For the discussion this week, take a few moments to introduce yourself to the class and share some information so we can get to know each other. I will use the information you provide this week to pair you up into groups for your assignments.  

Please answer the questions as accurately as possible to help us work together to find the best partners for everyone. This is important because you will be in these same working groups all semester and will work together to complete assignments starting with Week 2. 

Please click on the "Introduce Yourself" button below to participate in the discussion.   

I will send you your group assignments early next week. Thanks, everyone!

## Draft
1.  **What aspects of this course are most interesting to you in particular?**  
    I'm actually super interested in research ethics! I'm always interested in ethics as applied to particular fields - design, UX, artificial intelligence - but most classes don't cover it. I'm also excited to learn more about data synthesis and try out some professional methods/workflows for that.  
    
2.  **What do you do for work, if you are currently working, or are you a full-time student?  
    **I'm an Associate Creative Director at Boston University in the Interactive Design department. Day to day, I lead website projects from start to finish, mentor designers, and do a little teaching on the side (thankfully, I'm not teaching my next class until September). I'm also in this program full-time because I am full-time no chill.  
    
3.  **What do you hope to do with your Brandeis degree? How might this help you with your career goals?**  
    I'd like to teach more in the long-term future, and ideally, I'd like to be in a position where I am able to push the fields of design and technology forward in experimental ways. This degree is helping me fill the gaps in information I've learned informally over the years, get me up to speed on best practices, and provide a new perspective. From a very practical perspective, it's also helping me build some academic writing and experimental projects to show that I have the capability of doing unique work that pushes my field forward if given the chance.  
    
4.  **Where are you located now (including your timezone)?  
    **I'm just north of Boston and in the EST timezone. Today is an oddball day for me, I'm typically a night owl, but occasionally I'll wake up at 5 or 6am for no real reason.
    
5.  **What days of the week do you have the most free time to work on group activities? (M, Tu, W, Th, F, Sa, or Sun)  
    **Saturday and Sunday for sure. I can be flexible on Friday and in the evenings throughout the week, though.
    
6.  **What hours of the day are you most free to do project work with your group? (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or Anytime)  
    **It's easier to say I'm not available 9-5 EST Monday through Friday unless it's a half hour or less. I strongly prefer evenings, you're going to be in for a bad time if you try to get me to talk before 10am EST.
    
7.  **Coffee, tea, seltzer, or other? (Dunks or Starbucks? Bagged or loose leaf? Polar or La Croix?!)**  
    C A F F E I N E. All of the above and more. Dunks for iced, Starbucks for hot, rooibos or green tea loose leaf, and regarding seltzer, store brand all day because I love a good deal. The only non-negotiable here is no dairy.      

Quick note - Amara Shaikh and I are hoping to work together in this class.  

**A visual:** Picture of me in my office at work, goofing around and striking a pose our former executive creative director was famous for. I work next to a concert venue, so I hang out at work before and after shows, occasionally with friends. I was in full gear after seeing Joywave in this picture. I usually sit like a normal human being at my desk, but I liked my outfit in this picture. I love colorful clothing and colors in general, as well as going to small concerts. My favorite live performance so far has been Weathers, who opened for someone else but I forgot who it even was because I ended up liking Weathers so much.  

Bonus picture of my weird dog, KK, also posing in what looks like a really weird and uncomfortable manner, except this is her natural state. She is named after KK Slider of Animal Crossing.
