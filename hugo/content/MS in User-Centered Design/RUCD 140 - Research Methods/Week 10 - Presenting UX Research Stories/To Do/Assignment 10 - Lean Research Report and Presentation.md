## Assignment 10: Lean Research Report and Presentation
**(Group Assignment) - Lean** **Report + Presentation Final Assignment**

This final assignment has TWO parts:

PART 1 Lean Report

Read the [How to Write a Lean Report doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VzjT7Krwc9OFpQheqrcVPicIQGTRNAo8dc6ANSVdOZA/edit#heading=h.n16sozmydjs5) to understand what you should include in your final report. This report should provide a summary of all of the work you've done this semester, your recommendations for future work, and an appendix with links to your research docs from other assignments.  

PART 2 Presentation

You must create a slide deck with 10-30 slides and record a presentation of your slides via Zoom. Please use the slide notes to include any talking points that are not captured on your slides. Make sure you use a font of at least 18pt font size for your text.  

You will turn in a link to your slide deck and a recording of your presentation. Recordings should be 10-20 minutes in length.
