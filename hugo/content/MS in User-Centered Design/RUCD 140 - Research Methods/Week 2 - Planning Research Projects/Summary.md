## Readings
The readings for this week focus on research planning, recruiting, and interviewing. As you read through them, consider how you might use the results of these efforts as a designer. Though you may not leave this class wanting to be a researcher, you should leave it with a sense and understanding of the level of effort, and detail, and rigor that goes into preparing and conducting a user research study. Some companies may even require designers to advocate for and conduct their own research or participate fully in the user research cycle through observations and debriefs or other helpful tasks such as note-taking. This class aims to prepare you for all of that and more.

## Professor's notes
Hello researchers and welcome to Week 2!

This week we will focus on planning a research study. As a part of that process, we will utilize a research workflow that will take us through learning more about what we need to know and understand before we can begin to conduct research. We will also learn about different research methodologies and how to choose the right one to get the job done. You will all receive an announcement from me with your assigned working groups and for the majority of you, this will be just one or two other people from the course.Â 

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

-   Understand the difference between generative (exploratory & discovery) research and evaluative (formative & summative) research and identify when each should be employed
-   Get to know your partner(s) you will work with for the rest of the semester
-   Utilize a user research workflow to provide structure for setting up a research study
-   Develop a group research plan including a semi-structured interview script using best practices for writing interview questions
