## Assignment: Planning Research Projects
(Group Assignment) This week you will be assigned to your groups with whom you will work throughout the rest of the semester. So, that will be our first goal of this week. You will need to work as a group to select a topic to research. My recommendation is to pick one broad enough that it is easy to find research participants that you can work with remotely to help you complete this work. Do not worry about what it will be like to design a solution yet. In fact, please try not to solutionize anything ahead of time. Our goal is to go problem finding first! Please reach out to me with any questions or guidance you might need to help your group get organized.
