# Group Status Update
**Group Status Update:** For our discussions every week your group will provide a status update as to our progress in the class.  

-   This update should be composed by the entire group together. Only one person in each group needs to post this status update in the discussion area, but please be sure to alternate which member of your group posts these updates each week so you share the posting process as equally as possible within each group. Title your post "Group X Week Y Update" where you replace X and Y with your group name and the week number.      

This group status update should include the following:

1.  How was your first group meeting? Did you run into any challenges finding a time to meet as a group and how did you solve these challenges? 
2.  Have you developed a schedule for how you will take turns posting to the weekly discussions and assignments? If yes, please outline your planned posting schedule. 
3.  As part of your update please hyperlink to a Google Doc (in view only) with a high-level overview of the most up-to-date project work to share with the class. See [directions on how to pull a hyperlink from a Google Document and then link it to a discussion post.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hV35uKXMgCVQj_HytJYZQW7JmwdaEEX90YhwMMRw_X4/edit?usp=sharing) 
4.  The work you intend to complete over the next week, 
5.  Any potential blockers/questions you may have at the current point in time.
