## Assignment 3: Interviews and Transcriptions with Thick Descriptions
Due in Week 4.

For Assignment 3, you will work together to conduct and transcribe at least 2 remote, semi-structured interviews. There are two roles for each interview, facilitator and note taker. You and your partner will each assume one role for the first interview and then switch roles for the next one. To conduct these, you will utilize the interview script and informed consent document you helped create last week. You will also need to know how to use Zoom to host a meeting and record it.   

**IMPORTANT**

Be careful with who you recruit. I don't recommend interviewing people who you are very close with like parents, romantic partners, or roommates. Try to have the interview moderated by the person least familiar with the participant. So if my co-worker is acting as participant, I would ask my partner to conduct the interview and I would play the role of note taker. If you are the note taker you should say hi and then be video off for the interview. The moderator can ask if you have any questions at the end. This is less distracting for the participant.  

Your interview must take a minimum of 20 minutes. While it can go longer, I recommend not going too long as the second part of your assignment is transcribing the entire interview word for word. In most cases, it takes approximately 3 times the length of the recording to transcribe it.

Before beginning, read the complete [Assignment 3](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=2236364) prompt in Week 4. Though it is not due until the end of Week 4, you should start on it now as you cannot complete the next assignment until this one is done. This is a group assignment, so you will need to coordinate with your partner to complete this work.

**Interviews and Transcriptions with Thick Descriptions (Group Work)  
**

This assignment will provide a set of best practices for your partnered interviews. You will also learn how to document context and thick descriptions in your transcription of your interviews. Please review [[Conducting Good Interviews.pdf]] and [[Contextual Transcriptions.pdf]] for full details.

Interviewing is a skill mastered through doing. For this assignment, you and your partner will have the opportunity to utilize the script created last week to conduct partnered semi-structured interviews with target participants (minimum of 2 interviews per 2 person group). As you and your partner conduct the interviews, one will be the interviewer and the other will take notes. You will switch roles for the second interview. Notes should take into account the interviewee’s reactions to the questions including audible and non-verbal content. These notes will need to be included in the transcription documents, which are necessary for the analysis and synthesis portion of the class.  

Utilize your group’s research plan, informed consent, and interview script created last week to work with your partner to conduct a 20 minute recorded interview with someone who matches your target participants. Before you begin transcribing your interview, be sure to read the [**Contextual Transcriptions**](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/pluginfile.php/2881756/mod_assign/introattachment/0/Contextual%20Transcriptions.pdf?forcedownload=1) document for tips and tricks to learn how to do this quickly! Doing this remotely & recording with **[Zoom](https://kb.brandeis.edu/display/LTS/Getting+Started+with+Zoom)** can speed up your transcription process exponentially.
