# Week 3 Status Update
**Group Status Update + Video Comments due Saturday at 11:59 pm ET**

For our discussions every week your group will provide a status update as to our progress in the class. This update should be composed by the entire group together. Only one person in each group needs to post this status update in the discussion area, but please be sure to alternate which member of your group posts these updates each week so you share the posting process as equally as possible within each group.   

**Group Status Update**  

1.  Work you’ve completed since your group’s last update
2.  As part of your update please hyperlink to a Google Doc (in view only) with a high-level overview of the most current work to share with the class. See [directions on how to pull a hyperlink from a Google Document and then link it to a discussion post.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hV35uKXMgCVQj_HytJYZQW7JmwdaEEX90YhwMMRw_X4/edit?usp=sharing)
