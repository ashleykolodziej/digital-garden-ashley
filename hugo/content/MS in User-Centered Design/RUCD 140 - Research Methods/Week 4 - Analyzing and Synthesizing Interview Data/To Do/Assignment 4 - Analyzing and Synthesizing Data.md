## Assignment 4: Analyzing and Synthesizing Data
(Group Assignment) There are two assignments due this week. Assignment 3, which you began to work on last week, is due at the end of this week and Assignment 4 should be turned in as well. We will be analyzing and synthesizing our qualitative interviews this week to understand the data we’ve collected thus far. This will help us understand whether or not we can answer our Hypotheses and Research Questions or if we need additional data via a gaps analysis. Even if we think we can answer our Hypotheses and Research Questions, we should still seek out data that need further validation. 

Read the complete assignment prompts before beginning.

**Analyzing and Synthesizing Data Assignment** 

Collecting data is the first step of the raw data process in our research workflow. The next step is the analysis and then the synthesis of the collected data. Analyzing and synthesizing our data helps us understand all of the data, especially that data that we did not collect ourselves. Going through this process lets us understand how to then apply the data both to answering our research questions and to any design or further recommendations we will make based on these answers. 

Utilize [**Analyzing and Synthesizing Qualitative Data**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yYG6YqDQiLBU8FcMyq96jx_13uSVhk-3g8rVcC02fH0/edit) document for an in-depth description of how to do the work and what I am looking for when you turn it in. You can also review this [example of a synthesis doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V-7utny0LMHSY5xkPpKH_B_h8shH--ElPTqEmtJ8V40/edit#heading=h.7feljr632gu).
