# Week 5: Triangulating Interview Data with Surveys
**Dates:** August 10th-16th

This week we are going to take everything we have learned so far and shift gears into building a survey. While surveys seem very easy at first glance, the only thing that is easy about them is that they are so very easy to get wrong. You will use Google Forms to build and distribute a survey in support of your research topic.

## Readings
This week we will be crafting our very own formative user research surveys. We will be using these to validate our interview data and/or fill in the data gaps that we surfaced last week through our analysis and synthesis. This will help us triangulate our data as well as fill in missing pieces so that we can successfully answer our research questions and test our hypotheses and then apply what weâ€™ve learned to generative deliverables (week 6).
