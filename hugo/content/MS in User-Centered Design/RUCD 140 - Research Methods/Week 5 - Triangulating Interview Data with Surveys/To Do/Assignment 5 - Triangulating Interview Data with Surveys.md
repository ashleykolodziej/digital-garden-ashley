## Assignment 5: Triangulating Interview Data with Surveys
This week you come together as a group to craft & launch your survey created to validate your interview data and/or fill any research gaps that surfaced during last week's analysis and synthesis. 

Before beginning, read the complete [Assignment 5 prompt](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=1717788) in Week 6. Though it is not due until the end of Week 6, you should start on it now as you cannot complete the next assignment until this one is done. This is a group assignment, so you will need to coordinate with your partner to complete this work. For full details, refer to the [**Crafting Surveys**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvQZshd9FSGYiDW64ETgLgjRBWgIm6ZPXt_xfEsh9dM/edit#heading=h.tlbm6vsvb7bs) document.

**Triangulating Interview Data with Surveys Assignment**   

Use the gaps/validations document created as a part of your analysis and synthesis of your interviews from last week to start as a basis from which you will craft your survey questions for this week. Utilize this [[Crafting Surveys]] document for details on how to complete the assignment. 

Data triangulation allows you as a researcher the ability to support your results and recommendations through the utilization of multiple data points/sources. Additionally, understanding how to build and use formative surveys and how to recognize the difference between them and summative surveys such as NPS and Customer Satisfaction tools will help you utilize the right tool for the right reasons as well as understand and know when survey data is being used incorrectly.

Turning it in: Only one set of documents needs to be turned in for the group and please use the naming convention below.
