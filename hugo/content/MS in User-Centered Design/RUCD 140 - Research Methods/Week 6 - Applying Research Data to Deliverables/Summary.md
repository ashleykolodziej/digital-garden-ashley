## Readings
This week we will delve into how to make use of all of the data we’ve collected. There is nothing worse for researchers than to spend all of this time and effort doing the research and then for it to sit in a repository never to be seen again. Thus, it is our job as researchers to use it to make appropriate and applicable deliverables (aka "artifacts") and to make those deliverables useful to different groups.
