## Assignment 6: Applying Research Results to Deliverables
**(Group Assignment) Applying Research Results to Deliverables**

Take the data you’ve collected thus far based on the hypotheses and research questions you started with and use them to create a minimum of 3 Generative Deliverables. You can use Google Docs, Google Slides, or an exported PDF from a tool like Figma to create your assignment submissions.  

_Note: Next week we will be doing usability tests, which can either be on your own new work based on your research for this class, on existing related work (maybe a current site you intend/pretend to iterate on), or existing competitive sites to your project idea. If you are going to test your own work, #6 on this list is REQUIRED._

The ideal list and order are as follows. Pick any 3 from this list. Please make sure whatever 3 you pick that you do them in order with your partner because these all inform the next one on the list. Most items require a minimum amount.

1.  Contextual Personas (Minimum 3 - these count as a single deliverable)
2.  Journey Maps (Minimum 2 based on a single persona - include 1 as-is and 1 to be - these count as a single deliverable)
3.  Storyboards 
4.  User Flows (create a flow for at least 2 different personas/Journeys/User Stories - they must be different - these count as a single deliverable)
5.  User Stories (Minimum 3 Per Persona)
6.  Low-Fidelity Wireframes (Minimum 3 separate screens and not just different states of the same screen - these should be based on the needs surfaced in at least 1 Persona/Journey/User Story - these count as a single deliverable)**

** This one is required if you will be usability testing your own work.

For this class, you will create generative deliverables based on the data you’ve collected. That means these are not hypothetical or something you’ve solutionized with only internal input. Everything that goes into these deliverables should be based on the group’s interview and survey data. This is the first step in data-driven user-centered design. 

Additionally, the first thing every researcher should do on any work they are going to test is conduct a heuristic review. This will help catch any low-hanging issues that can be quickly fixed before testing. Doing this as early as possible helps save both effort and time later down the road. 

**Turning it in:**

Please combine all deliverables into a single document (PDF is great) Full directions for what is expected of this document can be found in the **Generative Deliverables** document attached here. Only one person from each group needs to submit the final assignment for the group.
