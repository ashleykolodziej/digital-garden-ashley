# Week 7 - Planning and Conducting Remote Usability Tests
**Dates:** August 24th-30th

This week we will learn about usability (not user) testing. When most companies refer to user research, they are usually referring to usability testing. While usability testing is indeed important, it is a very small sliver of the research that could or should be done. This is especially true for new products or services, especially those where innovation is a key driver.
