## Assignment 7: Planning & Conducting Remote Usability Tests
For this assignment, you will create a usability testing plan, script, and notes grid. Then you'll work together with your partner to conduct a minimum of 2 usability tests.   

Before beginning, read the complete [Assignment 7 prompt](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=2236475) in Week 8. Though it is not due until the end of Week 8, you should start on it now as you cannot complete the next assignment until this one is done. This is a group assignment, so you will need to coordinate with your partner to complete this work. 

Refer to the **Usability Testing Guide** document found in both the assignment instructions as well as this week's readings for full details.

You may choose to conduct usability testing on your wire frames or on an existing app/website related to your research topic. You can use the live website for your usability test. For example, if my research topic was how people decide which stove to buy, I could conduct usability testing on [Wirecutter.com](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/) for this assignment.  

**Instructions**  

1. Create a usability testing plan based on the instructions in the Usability Testing Guide.  
2. Create a usability testing script with rapport-building questions, 3-5 tasks/scenarios, and ending/summary questions. Follow the guidance on [slides 24-33](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v-uIQwiJyrxYQaG_NLawpm-B8VIr9vbQQOYSUfX73ro/edit#slide=id.g8e6dba188d_0_90) to create effective tasks. Consider your original research goals when creating your tasks as well as what you learned in the interviews and survey.  
3. Create a notes grid to take  notes on the test sessions.  
4. Conduct one usability testing session per group member. Take notes in the notes grid.
