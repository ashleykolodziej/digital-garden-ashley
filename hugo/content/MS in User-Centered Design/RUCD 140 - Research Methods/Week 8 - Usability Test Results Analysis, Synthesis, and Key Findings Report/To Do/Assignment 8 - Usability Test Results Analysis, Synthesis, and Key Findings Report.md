## Assignment 8: Usability Test Results Analysis, Synthesis, and Key Findings Report
(Group work) **Usability Test Results Analysis, Synthesis, and Key Findings Report Assignment**  
  
Usability testing is only useful if the results are understood and the recommendations are actionable. This week we will analyze and synthesize the results from our tests to see where improvements can be made, what improvements should be made, as well as why they should be made based on our collected data. We will then collate all of those into a single easily consumable deliverable.
