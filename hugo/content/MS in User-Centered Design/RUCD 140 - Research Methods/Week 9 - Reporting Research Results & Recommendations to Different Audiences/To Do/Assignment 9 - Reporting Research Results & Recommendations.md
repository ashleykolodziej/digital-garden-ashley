## Assignment 9: Reporting Research Results & Recommendations (Executive Summary)
There is no assignment due this week, but you should start **Assignment 9 which is due at the end of week 10**. Work together on your Executive Summary, Lean Research Report, and Presentation. For full details refer to Assignment 9 description in Week 10. 

Read the complete assignment prompt found in week 10 before beginning.

**(Group work) Executive Summary**

It can be very hard for many people in an organization who need to know and understand our research to have the time to digest a full report on it. Thus, it is important to understand how to communicate what they need in a way that is easy for them to read (scan) and understand. That said, this does not alleviate the need for a full write-up. Rather, an executive summary is created to be easily digestible.  
  

This week we will begin putting the finishing touches on our work for the semester. Based on the work we have completed thus far, we will create an executive summary as a precursor to the final report & presentation.
