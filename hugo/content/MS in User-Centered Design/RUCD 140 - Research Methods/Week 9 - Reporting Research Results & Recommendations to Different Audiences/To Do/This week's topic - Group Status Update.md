# Group Status Update
For our discussions every week your group will provide a status update as to our progress in the class. This update should be composed by the entire group together. Only one person in each group needs to post this status update in the discussion area, but please be sure to alternate which member of your group posts these updates each week so you share the posting process as equally as possible within each group.   

This group status update should include the following:

1.  Work you’ve completed since your group’s last update
2.  As part of your update please hyperlink to a Google Doc (in view only) with the most up-to-date work to share with the class. See [directions on how to pull a hyperlink from a Google Document and then link it to a discussion post.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hV35uKXMgCVQj_HytJYZQW7JmwdaEEX90YhwMMRw_X4/edit?usp=sharing) 
3.  The work you intend to complete over the next week, 
4.  Any potential blockers/questions you may have at the current point in time.
