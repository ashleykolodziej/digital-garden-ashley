## Notes
A waterfall approach (Figure 4.3) involves treating the steps of a project as separate, distinct phases, where approval of one phase is needed before the next phase begins

The problem with a pure waterfall approach is that it assumes that each phase can be completed with minimal changes to the phase before it

An agile approach generally has a greater focus on rapid collaboration and a reduced 
focus on detailed documentation and formal sign-off.

### Lean UX

Lean UX is an agile project approach that’s well-suited to products being developed in the face of great uncertainty

designing an entire set of categories and subcategories of products may be wasteful if the team has not yet proven that they’re offering products that their target users are willing to purchase

Each iteration is "hypothesis that can be tested with users"

validating design decisions with customers and incorporating the subsequent changes that will help the team learn the next important lesson.

continuous loop of Build—Measure—Learn

Tests fail or succeed based on qualitative user feedback during  research, and on quantitative measures that are put in place to track success.

Care should be taken that the measures put in place really test the assumptions of that iteration

Teams don’t need to create a fully functioning digital version of their product to test a hypothesis (although a more robust digital version will eventually exist after several cycles, if things are going well 
on the validation front).

MVP - just enough to test

move away from formal deliverables and detailed documentation

For example, an agile approach requires 
very close collaboration. A waterfall approach may involve individual work 
most of the time, with touchpoints once or several times per week.

in a waterfall approach, where sign-o! is required before you move on  
to the next phase.
