# Discussion - UX Process Philosophies
-   What differences can you find in Agile UX, Lean UX, etc., if any and what is the underlying common philosophy behind these approaches?

-   In reflecting on this week’s readings, how do you understand it in context of the UX field?

## Draft

**What differences can you find in Agile UX, Lean UX, etc., if any and what is the underlying common philosophy behind these approaches?**

The main difference I see after this week's readings between Agile UX and Lean UX is that Agile was a software development process first, and Agile UX attempts to fit UX into that very specific process (Treder, 2013), while Lean UX is a UX process first that attempts to achieve the same goals as Agile development in a UX frame. Both aim to do "just enough" to test an idea, but agile's "just enough" is specific to deploying code or a feature, where Lean UX's "just enough" could be as simple as a sketch or paper prototype, so long as it can test a hypothesis (Unger, Russ, 2012). Since Lean UX only borrows the goals of Agile and applies it to UX deliverables, and does not rely on agile methodology specifically (Treder, 2013), I also think it may be possible to apply Lean UX in a waterfall framework. For example, several iterations of paper prototypes could be substituted for a complex, high fidelity prototype even if you are in a formal strategy phase of a project.

**In reflecting on this week’s readings, how do you understand it in context of the UX field?**

Similar to how there are many ways you could share your work with a team as a designer or frontend developer, I understand Agile and Lean UX to be different ways someone doing UX work could choose to determine what types of deliverables they create, when, and for what purpose. In Agile UX, the agile process comes first, so there may be more challenges with integrating UX deliverables in (Loranger, 2014) and methods that work in that workflow may be different than the methods you select when working with Lean UX. I'm not sure exactly how that would differ yet, but I think being familiar with options for both methods would be beneficial in the UX field, especially if you choose to freelance or contract with different companies.

## Notes

Pure agile
- a software methodology first
- build, iterate rapidly (Unger, Russ, 2012) with a goal of releasing *software or release* quickly
- Leverages user stories (Vipul @CanvasFlip, 2018)
- Still measures
- Focuses on communication over documentation (Unger, Russ, 2012)
- Unusual to be strictly followed (Unger, Russ, 2012)
- People cite tight deadlines and staffing shortages as reasons for deficiencies in user-centered activities. (Loranger, 2014)
- The ultimate goal of Agile UX is to unify developers and designers in the Agile process of product development. (Treder, 2013)

Lean UX
- Focus on getting to something which tests a hypothesis as quickly as possible (Unger, Russ, 2012)
- create low-fidelity prototypes as a way to demonstrate ideas and reduce heavy documentation (Loranger, 2014)
