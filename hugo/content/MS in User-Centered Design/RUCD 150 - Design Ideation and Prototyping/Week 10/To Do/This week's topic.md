## Draft
**What were your expectations about what you would learn when you started this class?** 
I came into this class expecting to learn new strategies for brainstorming and ideation, and that it would most likely be a very hands-on class where I'd be working in some sort of prototyping program. I think I imagined it having more group work due to some language about design thinking in the syllabus, but the brainstorming and design thinking theory that I pictured with this class was covered really extensively in RUCD 180, which I am also taking this semester, so that would have been really overwhelming for me if I did have to do that. I'm glad this class had some elements of working together, but largely focused on testing and refining concepts in retrospect.

I would have liked to be able to see and provide feedback on other students' work in the forums, especially in the prototyping and wireframing phases. A lot of our prompts focused on what it was like to test each week, but I would have loved an opportunity to practice some guided peer critique too. It might be the art school major in me, but critique is one of my favorite parts of the design process and I especially like when critique focuses on the goals of the work, whether they're being met, and how to take the work to the next level.

**You are trying to convince a colleague to take this class.** **Write a description of what they will learn in this course and its relevance to the work that you do.** 
Most of my colleagues have been working in design for quite some time and cobbled together what they could of a web design program in undergrad, so I would describe this as the class you kept saying you wished existed in undergrad a decade or more ago. You go through the full design process of ideation, strategy, prototyping, refinement, and documentation properly. It's like getting a chance to do your day to day work with user research and feedback truly integrated in, without skipping steps or having to fight your budget. Like most creative classes, you get what you put into it and the prompts are flexible enough that if you can't stand doing another responsive website design because that's what you do all day, you can use it to try out app design or other types of design pretty easily. So long as it solves a genuine user need and you can storyboard, paper prototype, draw out the user flow, and digitally prototype it to get feedback, you can do it in this class. This is a good class to get you out of your rut and try something new, and if you run into something familiar, find a way to make it unfamiliar. 

**Refer to particular activities, processes that you learned, tools that you used, reflect on group work vs. working as an individual.**
I haven't done app design before, and this process really challenged me to think more carefully about context and existing mental models, since the core of my idea went against existing digital models and expectations for finding restaurants. I've never done a storyboard in a UX context before - just video or step by step quizzes - so I'll definitely add that to my toolbox. It was also great to see the value of paper prototyping with users in real time too. I liked the balance of group vs. individual work in this class, and the only thing missing for me is opportunity for deeper critique.
