### 1600-1699: Measurement and theory
- Sets the stage for graphs, visual representation of data
- Data viz key focus: physical measurements, because now the tools exist to do it
	- what new types of data are we discovering now?
	- Makes me wonder about [[Artificial Intelligence]]
- time, distance, and spaceâ€” for astronomy, surveying, map making, naviga-
tion and territorial expansion
- geometry, coordinate systems
- error measurement and estimation
- probability theory
- demographics and political arithmetic (study of population, land, taxes, value of goods,
etc. for the purpose of understanding the wealth of the state)
	- so basically the census
