### 1900-1950: The modern dark ages
- Enthusiasm for graphics waned, replaced by statistical modeling - "more precise"
- Few innovations in graphics
- Instead of continued innovation, this era focuses on documenting, increasing mainstream popularity of graphics 
- Graphics found in textbooks, curriculums, government, social sciences regularly now
- Formalized / tested assumptions while waiting for new innovations to push graphics further

#### Key people
- Sir Arthur Bowley (wrote Elements of Statistics), used data smoothing/graphics to question conclusions drawn from tables

#### Key events
- Graphical data led directly to new insights, discoveries, and theories in astronomy, physics, biology, and other sciences
	- E. W. Maunder’s (1904) “butterfly diagram” - variation of sunspots over time, led to discovery that they were markedly reduced in frequency from 1645–1715
	- Hertzsprung-Russell diagram - log-log plot of luminosity as a function of temperature for stars, used to explain the changes as a star evolves, laid groundwork for modern stellar physics
	- Discovery of atomic number by Henry Moseley
- Studies to determine efficacy of experimental and innovative graphics
- Official standards and rules for graphics finally adopted
- New aids for graphing developed
