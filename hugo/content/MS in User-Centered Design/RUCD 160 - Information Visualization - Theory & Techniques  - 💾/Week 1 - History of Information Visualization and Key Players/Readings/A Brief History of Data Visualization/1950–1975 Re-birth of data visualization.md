### 1950â€“1975: Re-birth of data visualization
- Data behind perking up again due to a few key events

#### Key events
- John W. Tukey calls for data analysis to be separate/distinct from statistics in paper, reignites interest
- Semiologie Graphique reorganizes data visualization by visual features / relation to data
- Fortran is built, computers enter the picture at major universities and allow data processing through computers
- Interactive stats developed, but not yet mainstream
- Computer science research collaborations begin with Bell/others
- Display/input technologies are developed - digitizer, mouse, etc
- New types suggested: Fourier function plots, [[Chernoff faces]], [[star plots]], [[clustering]] and [[tree representations]])

#### Key people
- **John W. Tukey** (statistician, invented stem-leaf plots, boxplots, hanging rootograms, two-way table displays, and so forth)
- **Jacques Bertin** (published Semiologie Graphique, "periodic table" of visualizations)
