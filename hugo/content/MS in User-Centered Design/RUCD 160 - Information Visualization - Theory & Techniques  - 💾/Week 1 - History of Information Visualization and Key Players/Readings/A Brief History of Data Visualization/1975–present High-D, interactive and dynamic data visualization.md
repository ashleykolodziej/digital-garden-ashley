- New ways of manipulating data visualizations developed - linking, brushing (Becker and Cleveland, 1987), selection, focusing, etc
- New methods for visualizing [[high-dimensional data]] - the grand tour (Asimov, 1985), scatterplot matrix (Tukey and Tukey, 1981), parallel coordinates plot (Inselberg, 1985, Wegman, 1990), spreadplots (Young, 1994a), etc
- New graphical techniques for discrete and categorical data
- People start really caring/paying attention to cognition and perception of data, accuracy based on that
- Development of large-scale statistical and graphics software engineering
- increased computer processing speed and capacity
