## Notes
- Excessive design creates distraction, and distraction makes it more difficult to accurately read data. (Find source for this assertion)

- divide and conquer, time based items using line instead of bar chart - better show of relative trend
- Bar graphs are more effective for comparison than pie charts because you can more easily tell the actual values, and the shape comparison is not affected by angle, proximity to the comparison shape, etc (my explanation)
- Also, hierarchy in a pie chart is not clear, nor are relative comparisons when the numbers don't have large gaps between each other, or pieces are roughly equal
- graphs employ visual processing in the brain
- tables interact with verbal systems
