# Introduce Yourself

Please take a few moments to introduce yourself to the class and share some information so we can get to know each other. Be sure to include the following information:  

-   Your name
-   Which program you are enrolled in and how far along you are in the program
-   What you do for work currently
-   What you are hoping to gain from this course

# Data Awareness
Think about your last week and examples of where you have consumed or interpreted data to make decisions. Some examples may be a fitness application dashboard on your phone, a stock market graph,  the weather app forecast, a menu at a restaurant, mint.com or banking information, the electronic displays in your car, the board showing arrivals and departures at the airport, political charts or graphs shown in the news. 

Take a closer look and discuss what information you take away and how you used that information this week. Also mention two sources of data in your life that you depend on. What makes it easy to get this information? what makes it difficult? What mechanisms or mediums that display this information have you chosen to get this information and why?

Be sure to answer all questions in your post and refer to the syllabus for expectations and grading criteria.

# Reflection of data I have consumed in the past week

This week, I consumed many types of data passively, but a recent example actually significantly changed my behavior. My partner sent me a matrix diagram (What Is a Matrix Diagram or Chart? Data Relationship Analysis | ASQ, n.d.) from the Wall Street Journal on how different types of masks affect COVID-19 transmission time ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/cloth-face-mask-omicron-11640984082](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cloth-face-mask-omicron-11640984082)). After seeing how much longer the transmission time of an infectious dose of COVID-19 would be if I were wearing a KN95, I felt safer going into my office, and changed my mask from a cloth mask to a KN95.

I also used tables in the new GitHub Projects beta, which helped me remember the number of hours each task was estimated to take. I then used that information to help plan which tasks my team should work on next week.

# Sources of information I rely on

## The weather

The first source of data I rely on is information about the weather. For context, I only really care about the weather once a week, when I’m planning what to make for dinner for the week. Day to day, it’s easy enough for me to just look out the window and take a good guess at what I need to wear. When I plan what to eat for the week, though, I’ll know for sure that soup will always sound good to me on a rainy day, and that if it’s sunny and warm relative to the rest of the week, that is a day I should plan to eat vegetables.

I have many choices for getting weather information, but my preferred source is the graphic you get when you do a simple Google search for weather in your area. I find the colorful icons that Google uses highly effective in quickly communicating to me what type of weather I can expect each day for the week. Figure 1 demonstrates that varying both the colors and shapes for different icons, while keeping certain elements, such as the sun, consistent, makes it very easy to identify which type of weather I am looking at.

The presentation of weather data in a Google search result for “weather malden ma” allows me to immediately identify which types of weather are predicted to happen each day for the following week using icons. I am also able to quickly compare the potential warmth or coolness of days relative to others in the week. Screenshot from _weather malden ma - Google Search_ (2022).

Another option I have for seeking weather information is the weather widget on my iPad. Comparing Figure 2 to Figure 1, it is much easier for me to see differences at a glance in Google’s design.

This presentation of weather data is more difficult for me to quickly understand because the colors in the icons do not change when the weather is different. It is also much less useful to me because it shows an hourly overview instead of a weekly overview, which is much too detailed for my needs. Because the widget shows me a set of data that is irrelevant to me, I have learned to ignore it. Screenshot from iPadOS version 15.2.1 (2022).

## My budget

A second source of data I rely on and update daily to make decisions is my budget. I started using You Need a Budget (YNAB) as my budgeting app when, after 10 years of using Mint.com, I got fed up with constantly overspending and feeling guilty about it.

I loved the beautiful charts and reporting in Mint, but even though I had 10 years of spending data logged, I could never forecast my spending correctly. Looking at the interface in Figure 3, I can now see why. In Chapter 1 of _Show Me The Numbers_, Stephen Few (2012) argues the pie chart is one of the least effective methods of graphing data due to the difficulty in comparing similarly sized slices. Indeed, the pie chart grabs my attention first, and in this screenshot, it is difficult to tell exactly how much of a difference there was between Bills and Utilities and the dreaded “Other” category.

The pie chart view in Mint made it difficult to compare similarly sized categories, and did not present any numerical context, such as labels for category-based spending, to make these comparisons possible. Visual representations of data prioritize money already spent. From _Best Budget Apps for iPad_ (2015).

The ultimate problem with Mint was that the presentation of my financial data highlighted what I had spent, not what I had left. Every piece of information that Mint gave me was about a decision I had no control over anymore. Mint’s data also relies on transactions, which causes a delay in information, making overspending more likely.

By contrast, the way that YNAB works is by using a zero-based budgeting method, where every single dollar in hand is given a job, be it to be saved or to be spent (What Is Zero-Based Budgeting?, n.d.). For example, in Figure 4, you can see I assigned $95.00 to hair at the beginning of this month. Its job is to wait for my next hair appointment. Visually, the highest priority information in this graphic is not what I’ve spent on my hair, but what I have available to spend on my hair in the far right. Every time before I enter a transaction, I look at the available to spend column to make sure I’m not overspending.

YNAB takes a significantly different approach to visualizing budget progress. Amounts of money remaining are visually prioritized in a table-style view. Screenshot from You Need a Budget (YNAB) iOS App (2022).

At the end of the month, I still have occasional overspending. In YNAB, when this happens, you reallocate funds. Figure 5 demonstrates the change in color of both the progress bar and available to spend bubble to yellow which happens when a category is underfunded. This reinforces that I am taking my goal off-track when this happens, and makes me think twice about overspending. If the transaction is a priority, I go ahead and enter the transaction and move the money.

Towards the end of the month, a yellow color indicates where I have “stolen” from myself to cover expenses in other categories. As I make these decisions throughout the month, the progress bars to the left play an important role in tracking overall progress towards goals and helping me make informed decisions on how far I will set myself back in those goals when I reallocate funds from them. Screenshot from You Need a Budget (YNAB) iOS App (2022).

Although Mint and YNAB hold the exact same data, the future-forward use and presentation of my financial data in YNAB is much more effective in preventing unintended overspending. Additionally, because I enter transactions into YNAB manually, there is never a delay in data to surprise me like I had with Mint.

Finally, the table presentation of category information communicates much more information to me quickly, and allows me to compare category balances and reallocate funds quickly as needed. In his closing words in Chapter 1, Few (2012) suggests that tables activate our verbal processing systems and excel at the presentation of detailed values, while graphs activate our visual system and excel at presenting patterns and relationships. I can clearly see in this lens that YNAB’s choice of progress bars is an excellent match for quickly communicating the relationship between goal and progress towards goal, while the table excels at showing my detailed remaining money down to the cent.
