## RUCD160 Final Project – Design an Information Dashboard
Overview:
For the final project, I’d like you to imagine a project at your workplace where the product owner needs to make decisions to inform the feature roadmap for next year. The product owner has asked you to assemble an information dashboard of key performance indicators for the website for review to aid in planning.

Explain the dashboard in relation to the audience and the environment it will be used. Also explain why you chose the chart types you did based on the data represented. You can assume for this assignment that the dashboard will be viewed primarily through a web interface viewed on a desktop/laptop display.

## Instructions & Output:
**Data Selection**
1. Draft a brief description for each data set chosen and how it would help in the decision making for your target audience.
2. The data can be made up data but should be logical for the domain.
3. 
**Chart Selection(s)**
1. The information dashboard should consist of 3-4 charts.
2. Explain the rationale for each chart type chosen based on the data you have shown to
represent. Explain the advantages of representing the data with the chart type for each.

**Application of Best Practices**
1. Sketch or use a computer to create your charts and assemble them into a dashboard.
2. Indicate the use of best practices on each of your charts similar to how we have been doing for our assignments throughout the course. Basically put callout numbers directly on the dashboard as is done for wireframes and have a list of written annotations that the callouts refer to. This step is one of the most important aspects of the final assignment to demonstrate your understanding of best practices use for the 3-4 different charts types you have chosen to incorporate in your dashboard.

**Dashboard Design**
1. Remember to declutter not only your individual charts but also the resulting dashboard you have created. Design where the eye is drawn first, second, and third with intent. Explain why you placed the charts where they are in your dashboard

### To consider:

- Summaries (p. 94 information Dashboard design )
- Exceptions (p. 94 information Dashboard design)
- Narrow information to that which directly applies to the decision (IDD)
- Understand how audience models data mentally (weeks, months, quarters)
- How is the number rounded or customized to the audience? (IDD - accountant vs ceo)
- When was the data last refreshed, and how often should it refresh? (IDD p199)


### Possible indicators
- Number of upvotes/feature request tickets
- Activity on feature requests 
- Does it have an open pull request?
- Number of support tickets
- Pages with high bounce rate and low time on page from Google Analytics
- Drop-offs in critical funnels
- Number of requests through account
- Is it tied to an existing project?
- How much effort is it?
- What is the benefit?

Goal:
- **Improve the accessibility of BU websites**
