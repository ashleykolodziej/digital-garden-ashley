## Week 10 - 3D visualizations, context, and tracking human movement

Number of replies: 2

I was particularly captivated by the 3D interactive chart by the New York Times this week. It’s fun to play with, new, and different, so I was really inclined to explore it on my own. A really fun and interesting touch I found was that when I viewed the chart from “the back”, the labels flipped around so I could still read them:

My favorite part, though, is that unlike other 3D graphs I’ve seen, the story of this graph is narrated using several slides. After the novelty wore off, the slides helped me understand the data more clearly, starting by introducing me to the element I was most likely to be unfamiliar with, the z-axis. It also sets the stage for the rest of the story.

It would help me to have an axis label here since I’m not as familiar with what these interest rates really mean, but the explanation helps give me context.

I was even more impressed by how the New York Times used this 3D plot to its advantage and compare long term interest rate changes to short term interest rate changes.

It did take me a moment to process what this meant and how it connected visually, but once the graphic taught me this context, I had a whole new view of this data and wanted to explore even more.

As I explored this, I found myself reflecting most on what we learned from Cole Knaflic in our Storytelling with Data readings, and how critical the storytelling and context was in helping me understand this new graphic type. Stephen Few’s work has also really changed how I see data, and made me initially wary of this chart type as potentially gimmicky and difficult to understand. As we explore emerging visualizations in the future, perhaps storytelling and context will be key in teaching us how to navigate more complex datasets and interfaces. From a practical perspective, I know I’ll be referencing the Wall Street Guide frequently from now on as well.

I explored the New York Times’ work a bit more after this, and learned about an article where a journalist tracked her husband to better understand the privacy implications of technology such as Tile and Apple Airtags. In the discussion of his experience as the husband who was tracked, Trevor Timm (2022) explained, “…what I was not prepared for was how easily my actions could be misinterpreted.” Although the journalist had the data of both a location and a photographer who followed her husband, the combination of the two was still not enough to avoid coming to deeply incorrect conclusions. This quote, among them all, stood out to me:

“At lunch time, Kashmir texted me, ‘Are you somewhere fancy?’ Perplexed, I responded no. I learned later her location trackers suggested that I had stopped at the private club Dumbo House. _Imagine the interpretations!_ In fact, I was at a food court directly below Dumbo House eating a taco.”

Realizing the power of storytelling and context, and how missing, inaccurate, or improperly contextualized data can truly change viewer’s actions and understanding, this story and its implications as we gather more and more data to be analyzed really stuck with me.

Thank you for the wonderful discussions, thoughtful course material, and a wonderful first semester here at Brandeis. I hope to see familiar faces in future classes!
