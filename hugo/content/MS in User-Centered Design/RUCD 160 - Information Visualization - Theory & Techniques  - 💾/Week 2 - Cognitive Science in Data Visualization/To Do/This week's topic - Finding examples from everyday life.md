# Finding examples from everyday life
Find an example of visualization online or in a public setting and analyze it for aspects that would affect attention, memory, and failure to apply Gestalt principles.

"Preattentive visual processing detects several attributes, such as color and the location of 
objects in 2-D space. 

If you want something to stand out as important in a table or graph, 
you should encode it using a preattentive attribute that contrasts with the 
surrounding information, such as red text in the midst of black text. " show me ch 5

Two fundamental characteristics of 
working memory are:
• It is temporary.
• It has limited storage capacity. Show me 5

f you design a graph that includes a legend with a 
different color or symbol shape for 10 different sets of data, your readers will be 
forced to constantly refer back to the legend to remind themselves which is 
which because working memory is limited to three or four concurrent chunks of 
information.

How to declutter your data visualizations

Effective use of connection through line graph, helps follow relationships for many countries over time (vs scatterplot). 

"The most effective of these (preattentive attributes for quantitative perception) is 2-D position" (Few, 2012), which is used to represent the popularity of Christmas music over time. The line graph effectively uses the Gestalt principle of connection to effectively follow these relationships by country over time (video source here), and the principle of similarity makes it easy to group playing trends across all countries into peaks and valleys.

#### Aspects which detract attention and memory

I analyzed The Approaching Worms of Christmas, which is a graph of how the ratio of Christmas songs to overall songs played changes by country over time.

The use of 20 distinct colors in repeating order, both bright and muted, overloads the maximum 8 hues we can preattentively distinguish, and highlights certain information over others without any clear pattern or reasoning. These choices create a significant burden on working memory (Few, 2012). 

Because the colors are not applied with any pattern or proximity in mind, no clear groupings emerge to help make sense of patterns in related countries (Few, 2012), even though the caption clearly says readers should be able to see that countries of the Filipino diaspora start the Christmas music season in September.

Other ineffective aspects of this chart include the number and use of vertical labels. In her video, _How to Declutter Your Data Visualizations_,  Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (2016) explains that in graph labels, "diagonal text is about 50% slower to read, and vertical text is even slower." 

There are also too many date labels to understand how the patterns in spikes of Christmas song ratio relate to the days of the week, which makes it difficult to draw a relationship between the data and your mental model of a typical week. Remembering the final outcome or story of the data is much more difficult as a result.
