# Assignment: Applying Data Visualization Principles
## Assignment Overview:  
For this exercise, you should find an example static chart in an article on the web or from a print source and  
explain how you would make it better using some of the data visualization principles you have learned.  
  
## Details:  
1) Identify a static chart in a current article on the web or from a print source.  
2) Get a screen capture or take a photo of the chart and put it onto a page in a wireframing program.  
3) Annotate the chart you choose with the identified flaws and your suggestions for improvements (it should look basically like an image with numbers for reference by certain elements and a table to the right of annotations, like you would create for a wireframe with explanations of visualization elements).  
4) Cite relevant class readings and your own research which inform your suggested enhancements.  
  
### Some things to include in your analysis:  
- What story does the chart communicate? 
- Was the message clear or did you have to work hard to interpret it?  
- Would a different chart type have better communicated this story?  
- What did visualization designer use to attract your attention and where?  
- What detracts from the message and adds unnecessary clutter or noise?  
- What changes would you consider making to the chart?
