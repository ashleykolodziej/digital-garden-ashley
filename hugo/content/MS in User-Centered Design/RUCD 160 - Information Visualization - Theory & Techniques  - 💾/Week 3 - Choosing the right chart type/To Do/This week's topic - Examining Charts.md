# Examining Charts
Read through Chapter 2, Chart Smart of the WSJ Guide to Information Graphics., which compares good and bad chart examples, discuss 2-3 principles you learned and how you would apply them to your work.

![[WSJ Guide "On Color" pp. 40-48 and Chapter 2, Chart Smart]]

## Draft
I found a lot of the priniciples in Chapter 2 to be really interesting, but my favorites were  ones that reminded me of something I did. For example, on page 72, Dona Wong (2013) talks about how demographics charts sometimes plot the number of males on one side, and the number of females on the other, making it hard to compare the data. I realized I made this mistake in a story I designed a while back:

I now see that having bars on the left implies that the scale is negative. Next time, I'll use two bar charts.

I also found the chart in a table suggestion on page 83 helpful. At work, I have to assess the risk of upgrading codebases during major upgrades, and potential client impact. I could use a chart in a table to more clearly visualize which codebases are used on the most websites, and are therefore the riskiest to upgrade.

As a designer, I found "avoid partial icons" on page 88 to be really helpful. I use icons to help keep readers engaged and provide visual contrast with denser information, but I spent time on this idea only to find out half a human really *is* awkward and disturbing looking. Knowing that icons are best for times when there are large differences in data (Wong, 2013) and remembering partial icons are not recommeded will save me time in the future.

As a designer, I found "avoid partial icons" on page 88 to be very useful as well. I use icons to help keep readers engaged and provide visual contrast with denser information, but I have spent time on this idea in the past only to find out half a human really _is_ awkward and disturbing looking. Knowing that icons are best for times when there are large differences in data (Wong, 2013) and remembering partial icons are not recommended will save me time in the future.
