Discuss where you encounter line charts and sparklines in real world settings and share examples of effective use and bad use of line charts, and explain why.

## Draft
I've recently been using Fidelity's portfolio performance line chart to help ground myself during this recent bout of stock market volatility. One of my favorite features of it is that it allows you to change the amount of time you're looking at. I learned last week that changing the y-axis can misrepresent the trend (Wong, 2013), but I thought it was interesting to see how much changing the x-axis changed how I felt about my retirement account this past few weeks. Looking at Figure 1, I feel nervous because it looks I am losing a lot of my retirement. But in Figure 2, I'm reassured because I see it's a small dip over a two year period, and I weathered something like this two years ago and was fine.

Since the purpose of this line chart is to show the trend of portfolio value, the lack of points along the line is appropriate and helps keep the line chart clean and easy to read (Few, 2013). It also includes some features of a sparkline that I find helpful, such as the final value label (Few, 2013). A unique feature of Fidelity's graphs that I haven't seen elsewhere is placing the y-axis to the right of the chart. Since my current portfolio value is one of the key pieces of information I am comparing historical values with, I tend to read this type of graph right to left instead of left to right. The y-axis is also appropriately scaled in Figure 2 so that the chart comprises 2/3 of the chart area (Wong, 2013). My only criticism of these charts is that in Figure 1, the y-axis is scaled so that the chart takes up nearly the entire area, which may be exaggerating upward and downward movements (Wong, 2013) and affecting my reaction to that information.
