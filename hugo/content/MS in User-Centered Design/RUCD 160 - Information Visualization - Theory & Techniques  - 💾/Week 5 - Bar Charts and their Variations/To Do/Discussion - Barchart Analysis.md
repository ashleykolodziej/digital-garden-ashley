# Discussion - Barchart Analysis
Discuss where you would see bar/column charts and their variations in real world settings and share examples of effective use and bad use of bar charts, and explain why

## Draft
Add draft notes here.

- Census population lines were unclear - I had to reread several times to understand that data was associated with those lines. Using Few's (2012) bullet charts as bars would more clearly demonstrate the gaps and oversges between wealth held and share of census population.
- It seems odd to use data from two different years in the same chart.
- Storytelling: bars should be wider than the space between the bars. Overall, the width of this chart is too wide, and both the space between bars and the width of the bars themselves should be reduced so that the focus of the data stays on height, not overall area.

Information Dashboard design
- Bar graphs are good for displaying information associated with multiple segments in a category
- good choice for comparing values

Storytelling
- The chart correctly uses a zero baseline to avoid exaggerated and false comparisons.
- Data isn't labeled directly. This correctly keeps the emphasis on the overall trend of the percentage of wealth and population distribution held by white people versus all other populations. Labeling the data directly would encourage comparisons between Black and Hispanic wealth, which is irrelevant when white folks have a significantly disproportionate share of wealth in comparison.

WSJ
- The bars are correctly ordered from most to least in terms of data.

## Final
## Week 5 - Bar Charts and Household Wealth Distribution

#### Bar charts in my life

In my day to day life, I usually see bar charts in either business or journalistic contexts. For example, I work with project managers who create burndown charts for our projects, which show a combination of the overall number of hours left on the project, and how many hours were logged each day. This helps us start to gauge progress. I occasionally encounter them in apps, such as my time tracking software, but primarily, I see bar charts used in news stories and journalism.  

  

#### This week's analysis: Distribution of Household Wealth in the U.S.

While I was browsing Tableau Public this week, I found a really interesting graphic where the story is all about how the author accidentally skewed data by going for beautiful area charts first, and then ended up at a bar chart after trying a bunch of different charting methods and realizing all of them were making the data difficult to comprehend, or skewing it. I chose to analyze the final bar chart in isolation in Figure 1, but the whole graphic is really interesting, so I'm also including that in Figure 2 at the end.

The final bar chart in _Home Inspection_ (Abraham, 2021) more clearly shows the gaps in household wealth between white folks in the United States and all other populations, but still has room for improvement.

##### Properties of this chart which work well

-   The final choice of a bar chart is correct, since the goal of this dataset is to compare household wealth differences in the U.S. by race (Few, 2013).
-   The chart's y-axis correctly uses a zero baseline to avoid exaggerated and false comparisons (Knaflic, 2015).
-   Data is not labeled directly, which correctly keeps the emphasis on the overall trend of wealth held by white people versus all other populations. Labeling the data directly would encourage comparisons between Black and Hispanic wealth, which is irrelevant when by comparison, white folks have a significantly disproportionate share of total wealth (Knaflic, 2015).
-   The bars are correctly ordered from most wealth to least wealth held, making the overall trend easier to understand (Wong, 2013).

##### Properties of this chart which could be improved  

-   This final chart uses household wealth data from Q2 2021, but compares it to 2020 Census data for overall population distribution data. Using data across two different years is distracting, and without additional explanation as to why, concerns me that the author is cherry-picking certain years to demonstrate a point.
-   The census population lines were unclear to me. I had to reread several times to understand that census data was associated with those lines, and that their intent was to show the gap between population distribution and wealth distribution. Using Stephen Few's (2013) bullet charts as bars would more effectively demonstrate the comparison between wealth held and share of census population at the race level while telling the overall story of household wealth distribution by race.
-   In _Storytelling with Data_, Cole Knaflic (2015) notes that in bar charts, bars should be wider than the space between the bars. Overall, the width of this chart is too wide, and both the space between bars and the width of the bars themselves should be reduced so that the focus of the data stays on height, not overall area.
-   Labeling of bars relies on color alone, which is an accessibility problem (Universal Design Center © California State University, 2017). The labels for each race should be positioned next to the data it represents to fix this.

The information graphic _Home Inspection_ (Abraham, 2021) shows how the author attempted to represent data in a more complex manner than bar charts, and why it failed for this dataset.
