# Title
Discuss where you encounter text and table data in real world settings and share examples of effective use and bad use of text and tables, and explain why

## Draft
I use and encounter tables heavily in my day to day life. A few examples are my time tracking software at work, ActiveCollab, which helps me understand where I'm billing and how productive I am. I also create a lot of spreadsheets, so I format a lot of information in tables and find it easier to think of in that way. My coworkers and I also track status of work in tables/spreadsheets because it's a great way to show lots of data in a compact format and quickly look up a value (Few, 2012).

### Airline ticket purchasing 
Dora's airport departures analysis this week inspired me to take a close look at ticket purchasing pages at JetBlue and United, which both use a table format to show ticket options, but do so very differently. I think JetBlue is more successful, and I'm curious to hear what others think.

#### United interface

#### What's working well
- Tables are an excellent choice in both user interfaces, because tables facilitate comparison and lend themselves to showing precise information such as pricing and flight duration (Few, 2012).
- Both interfaces avoid unnecessary zebra striping (Few, 2012).
- In United's interface, columns are correctly ordered from least expensive to most expensive (Few, 2012).
- In JetBlue's interface, color and text are used to quickly highlight and annotate context that will be important to the reader - in this case, which flights are quickest and least expensive (Knaflic, 2015).

#### What can be improved
- United's pricing table has a lot of extraneous elements which distract from pricing and flight information and reduce the data-to-ink ratio. For example, the border width changes between different ticket types don't relay any information that isn't captured in labels.
- There isn't a clear reason why basic economy is in orange in United's interface, while all other types are in blue. Unnecessary changes in color, especially between data of the same type, should be avoided (Wong, 2013).
- United uses a variation on grid cells by outlining every ticket fare, creating unnecessary distraction and making comparisons more difficult (Few, 2012).
- In JetBlue's interface, while the white space is effectively used to group information, it exceeds the ideal 1 to 1 spacing ratio, creating wasted space (Few, 2012). Reducing space a bit would still be effective, but allow a user to compare more values at once. The same can be said for United's interface.

Overall, I prefer JetBlue's table because it has fewer distracting elements and clearly labels the information I'm most interested in. I'm curious what others think!
