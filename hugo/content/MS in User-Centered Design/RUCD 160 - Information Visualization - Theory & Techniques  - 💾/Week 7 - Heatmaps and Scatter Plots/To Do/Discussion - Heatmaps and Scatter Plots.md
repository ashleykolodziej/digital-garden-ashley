## Draft
Finally, a data visualization type I use a lot in my day to day work (or at least would like to)! I see heat maps all the time in a tool I use for unmoderated user testing called OptimalWorkshop. It allows you to run online card sorts, tree tests, and first click tests. The tool gives you a number of ways to view your results data, but my favorite way to see data is in heat maps. An example of a heat map generated by a first click test my colleague did last time the website I'm working on was redesigned is below. The task was "Where would you find information on what to do in case of an emergency?" In this heat map, Safety, Contact, and the Emergency callout at the bottom were popular answers.

I also use the Google Analytics plugin in Chrome, which allows you to see a heat map of items which were clicked on each web page as you browse the website.

## In-depth: Similarity Matrix

![[similarity-matrix.png]]

This similarity matrix is from a card sort I recently ran for an upcoming redesign of BU's research and research support websites, and uses heat map tactics to quickly relay relationships. Because we're combining two websites, I wanted to help the content strategist on my team get some fresh ideas on how users grouped items across both websites. This graphic shows which items were grouped together most frequently by users. The higher the percentage of users which grouped two items together, the darker the blue becomes. 

**What works well**
- Values are shown in cells, which helps with precision (Yi, n.d.).
- Choosing one color and varying the value helps show where patterns emerge among all the possible groupings quickly and effectively  (Few, 2012). 

I can also quickly see where connections may need to be made or confusion in labeling could arise. For example, I can see here that users grouped Find Funding both with Funding Opportunities for Students and Managing an Award and Preparing a Budget - two totally different audiences and use cases. 

**What could be improved**
- There is no legend, so it's not immediately clear what the color scale or labels represent (Yi, n.d.). I remember this being hard for me to understand at first.
- OptimalWorkshop says the most similar items are at the edges, but I have a hard time understanding how this data is sorted, other than groups seeming to emerge visually.
- I would increase the darkness of the blue at the high end of the scale to make groupings more easily apparent. Even the 90 is still a pretty light blue.

I also use the Google Analytics plugin in Chrome, which allows you to see a heat map of items which were clicked on each web page as you browse the website. I can’t remember a time where I’ve seen a scatterplot at work.

This is one of my favorite visualizations I work with because it helps me understand so much with just a glance.
