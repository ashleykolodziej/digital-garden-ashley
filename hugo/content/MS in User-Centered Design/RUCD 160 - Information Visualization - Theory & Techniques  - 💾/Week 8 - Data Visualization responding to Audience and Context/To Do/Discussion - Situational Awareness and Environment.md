# Situational Awareness and Environment
Discuss where you encounter visualization that has been customized for the environment and context of use in real world (like cockpits, working outside office environments) and share examples of effective use and bad use of factoring in decision time and context/environment into the data visualization display, and explain why.

## Week 8 - Customized visualizations and hybrid car dashboard

Number of replies: 1

#### Customized visualizations I’ve encountered 

I was surprised to realize I use a lot of customized visualizations on a daily basis. I use GitHub Projects, SmartSheets, and 10000ft at work, which help track the status of work and who is resourced on what work. I also use YNAB, which is budgeting software which shows me the status of my spending, and Garmin Connect, which works with my smartwatch to give me information about my health. I use an app called Interval Timer for exercising, which uses some [interesting design tactics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jGvYDcWIsv2lnbnQekUUq_q7lGTdrBC_/view?usp=sharing) to counteract the distance of my eyes to the screen while I’m exercising. For this week, I chose to take a closer look at my car’s dashboard.

#### Closer look: Hybrid electric car dashboard 

My car is a hybrid car, but acts like an electric car in that it can be plugged in to recharge. It will also not use gas at all if it has enough battery. Because the way I operate the car, including the weather and my driving style, has an effect on how long the battery lasts, some of the most important information to me in this dashboard includes how braking/acceleration are affecting the fuel life, how much battery I have left, how much gas I have left, and the fuel range estimate for both electric and gas mileage.

##### What works well

-   There are two gauges to the left and right which show how the engine reacts to my driving, each labeled by an icon that matches my mental model of the battery and engine. As I drive, there is a bar that animates up or down in this area to show if I am using (up) or replenishing (down) energy back to the battery. The large animation makes changes easy to see in my peripheral vision (Few, 2013). This allows me to see how my driving style affects fuel range without actively looking at the dashboard while I drive.
-   Having all electric fuel information to the left and all gas fuel information to the right, as well as coded in different colors, leverages the Gestalt principles of similarity and proximity so I can effectively process this information with a glance while driving (Few, 2013).
-   This dashboard is similar in needs to a mobile app in that I’m only accessing it in a driving context, so simplifying the graph of the fuel gauge and removing axis labels makes sense (Tapia, 2017). 

#### What could be improved 

-   The fuel gauge could be further simplified by removing the scale marks (Tapia, 2017), since I don’t know what they represent anyway and am mostly interested in how far I am from full, half tank, or empty in a relative sense.
-   Having the odometer reading directly next to the battery label is confusing, especially when the car is new, because its proximity implies that the mileage is related to battery - making it easy to mistake for the EV range. Placing the odometer reading in a more traditional area, such as the middle, better fits my mental model of car dashboards and would allow the actual fuel ranges to be placed up higher, closer to my field of vision while driving.
