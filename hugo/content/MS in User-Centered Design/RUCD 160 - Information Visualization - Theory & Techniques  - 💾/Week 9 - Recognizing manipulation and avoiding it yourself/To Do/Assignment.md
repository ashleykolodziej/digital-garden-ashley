- Looks like a stacked area chart, which implies location of data along y-axis is meaningful in the context of that country. This, along with recent reporting, inaccurately implies Russia has been hit hard with sanctions, when the true comparison that needs to be made is area. (Get source from Few - cognitive bias on positioning vs area readability)


**Storytelling with Data**
In his book, Beyond Bullet Points, Cliff Atkinson outlines the follow- ing questions to consider and address when it comes to setting up the story:
1. The setting: When and where does the story take place?
2. The main character: Who is driving the action? (This should be framed in terms of your audience!)
3. The imbalance: Why is it necessary, what has changed?
4. The balance: What do you want to see happen?
5. The solution: How will you bring about the changes?

If we pause to consider specifically the who, what, and how, let’s assume following:
Who: VP of Product, the primary decision maker in establishing our product’s price.
What: Understand how competitors’ pricing has changed over time and recommend a price range.
How: Show average retail price over time for Products A, B, C, D, and E.
The Big Idea, then, could be something like: Based on analysis of pricing in the market over time, to be competitive, we recommend introducing our product at a retail price in the range $ABC–$XYZ.
