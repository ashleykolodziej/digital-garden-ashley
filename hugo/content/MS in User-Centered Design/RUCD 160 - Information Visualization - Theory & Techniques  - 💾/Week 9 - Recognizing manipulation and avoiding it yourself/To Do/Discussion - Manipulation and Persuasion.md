# Manipulation and Persuasion
Discuss a time you have been wrongly manipulated by data when you had to make an important decision, and explain why. Discuss a time at work where you presented data to stakeholders to persuade them towards your position. What did you use, was it effective? Explain why or why not.

- Is the data using the right graphic type to effectively tell the story, or is the wrong type employed to hide or obscure an important trend? Has it been properly edited to focus on the story at hand? (Wong, 2013) 
- Is the data source reputable and impartial? (Wong, 2013)
- Does the chart attempt to "predict the future" or demonstrate projections alongside actual data? (Wong, 2013)
- Are percentages and other relative values contextualized with a base number? (Wong, 2013)
- Are large percentage changes happening with small numbers? (Wong, 2013)
- Rounding should never happen during analysis. (Wong, 2013)
- Are there multiple y-axis scales? (Wong, 2013)
- Has data been extracted in a misleading manner? (Wong, 2013)
- Are colors, grid lines, etc used consistently to avoid implying a false difference in meaning? (Few, 2012)
- Does the scale start with 0, or is it a broken scale? Is it omitted altogether to exaggerate differences? (Topic notes)
- Correlation does not mean causation (topic notes)
- Do percentages add up to more than 100%?

## Week 9 Discussion - Data and Salary Negotiation

Number of replies: 1

**Manipulation of data**  
  
I think the most important - and frustrating - time I have run into manipulation of data while making a major decision is in salary negotiation. As a worker, whenever I accept a new job or promotion, I am expected to make a projection about my worth and give my salary expectations. However, the actual salaries of most of my peers are a mystery to me because I have been taught that discussing my salary is taboo, and the data of those salaries is not publicly available. The only reliable data I have is my own historical data, and as a woman, I am in a group with a greater likelihood of making less than my colleagues (Gurchiek, 2019), making it difficult for me to change that or feel confident that I am negotiating for my work’s actual worth because of a lack of reliable salary data. While this isn’t a manipulation of data via visuals, the cultural taboo of discussing salary and the withholding of actual salary data at the employer level is a manipulation of data at the source level.   
  
**Pay ranges  
**One thing my employer does do well is publish salary grades and pay ranges, which does help. Here is the current salary and pay grade table:

I’ve never considered what the rule governing the minimum and maximum is with pay grades, but looking closely at this table, I see the rule is maximum salary is always twice the minimum salary. This might not be as much of a problem for negotiating at the minimum pay ranges, where the difference in thousands is relatively small. However, as pay grades increase, the range of disparity in wage gaps also increases, so that at the smallest pay grades, a $20k salary difference is possible, while at the highest pay grades, a pay gap of over 5 times that - $100k - is possible. Ranges of this size make it more likely my perceived worth will be out of line with how my company values me.  
  
This data is also missing context. What is a “50”, anyway? (The best answer I can give you is “the pay grade which maps to my current position, Associate Creative Director.”) How are pay grades correlated with years of experience or the type of job you do? None of this information is available here. In some cases, open positions will be posted with the matching pay grade, which helps. However, when I was recently in talks for a promotion, I wasn’t given the pay grade information, so I couldn’t use this range data to help frame my salary expectations - I had to guess which range I was jumping to. Ranges aren’t in numeric order either - in an older version of this system, my pay grade was 75, and I couldn’t find what my new pay grade was when grades were remapped.  
  
Dona Wong (2013) implores the importance of context in this week’s reading through both the presence of proper axis scales and presenting the “full picture” of data - not just cherry picking the pieces that are convenient for your case. An honest and equitable presentation of salary data would include not only the defined salary ranges - what the company hopes they will pay you - but the actual salaries mapped to position, years of experience, and ideally, factors which have historically driven wage discrimination such as race and gender.  
  
Other tools I use to try and wrestle with this include LinkedIn salaries, but because of the low response rates, wide ranges, and estimates, I never fully trust that data. A few screenshots are below.
