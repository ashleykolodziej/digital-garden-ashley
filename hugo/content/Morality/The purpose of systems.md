# The purpose of a system is what it does

**From Wikipedia:** According to the [cybernetician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetician "Cybernetician"), the purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic [dictum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictum "Dictum"). It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, [moral judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_judgment "Moral judgment"), or sheer ignorance of circumstances.

The logic here is that when we measure a system's effectiveness, we look at its output - what it does - as the ultimate measure of success in its design. Therefore, if a system produces a particular result, its design **must** be extremely effective at achieving that result. 

Where things get interesting is when intent doesn't match output. I like this concept because it forces you to work backwards from the output, and if you don't like the purpose that the output creates - in other words, it wasn't your intention - your only choice is to change the result, not just ignore it.

When people are protective of or defend ![[Intention]], it only serves to protect the broken systems and outputs, preventing a productive conversation about meaningful change in the system. I like this quote because it helps illustrate that more clearly.

I think this is a useful framework in management, social justice work, user centered design, and other situations where intent can easily disconnect from output, and allows good intent to be completely possible - and entirely irrelevant to solving the problem at hand. The best intent is the intent to improve.
