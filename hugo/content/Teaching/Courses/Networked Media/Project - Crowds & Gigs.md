# Project: Crowds & Gigs

This project is about crowds. What do you have to say to them? What can you learn from them? Working in partners, you will determine one topic or issue you want to address with a crowd. You will then determine one question or task to administer to a crowd. Once you have collected your results, you will use them to create a collective portrait of the crowd.

**Step 1:** Determine a topic or issue that your team would like to focus on for this project. It could be something in the news, an issue you feel needs more awareness, or anything else. The topic should be specific, and something you can form a point of view around. That is, "cats" or "the color red" are probably not appropriate topics.

**Step 2:** Think of a way to explore your topic with a crowd. Determine a question or task that will you will administer via social media, [amazon mechanical turk](https://www.mturk.com/), interviewing people in a virtual world, or some other online mechanism. You will need to collect at least 30 responses. By Tuesday 10/29 you should have initiated your question or task to the crowd. For example, you might ask each person to:

-   Answer a question.    
-   Give you a piece of information.
-   Give you a piece of media (image, sound, video, etc).
-   React to a prompt or statement.
-   Complete a task and send the results or documentation.
-   Do a part of a task that is divided up over many people.
-   Something else?

Here are some considerations:

-   **Clarity** – How will you communicate the question/task to people? How will you get them to respond?
-   **Scale** – You will need to be able to collect at least 50 results. What channel will you use?
-   **Output** – You will need to be able to display your results in some type of composition online, so consider the form responses will take.
-   **Privacy** – If you require a very personal or identifiable response, let people know their response will be included in a project that may be publicly viewable online.
-   **Decency** – How are you involving other people in your work? Are they able to consent? Are you treating them with respect?

**Step 3:** Use your results to create a collective portrait. You can use any web tools you like, including existing publishing platforms. The emphasis here is on asking and collecting meaningful results and presenting these in a compelling way.
