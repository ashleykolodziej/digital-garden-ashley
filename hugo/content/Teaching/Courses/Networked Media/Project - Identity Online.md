# Project: Identity Transformation

Create a webpage that transforms between two distinct perspectives or identities through the user's interaction with it. "Identity" could mean aspects of a personality, political perspectives, moods, cultural backgrounds, or anything else. "User interaction" could encompass click, hover, mouseout (leaving element), doubleclick, keypress, window resize, scroll, or anything else. Basically, your page should start in one mode, and look very different during or after user interaction. It is suggested that you make use of [JQuery events](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/) and [JQuery effects](https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/), though not all of these will be applicable.
