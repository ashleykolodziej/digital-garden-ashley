# Project: Interface

Create a homepage for a community. It can be for a community that you're involved with, one that you admire, or a fictional community. For instance, a site for a colony of robots that lives on the moon, a nonprofit organization of your choice, or a site for a UCLA student group that you're a member of or would like to start. You can imagine that this homepage is part of a larger website, but the links don't needed to lead anywhere.

You can write <a href="#">my link</a> to make a link that goes nowhere.

You can try to recreate layout and interface patterns you've seen online, or be more experimental with your design. In any case, your design should be clearly informed by the content it is representing. Just like with print design, how can you use web design to communicate an idea, identity, and community?

Your design does not need to be responsive, but should work on either a standard laptop monitor or a mobile phone (your choice). When you post your project link, also post a screenshot as it looks on your device for reference. See [tutorial on device preview](https://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Fall19/161/resources/preview) to preview your site for mobile. You can host the screenshot anywhere you like as long as it's publicly viewable (Dropbox, GDrive, Imgur, Flickr, etc).
