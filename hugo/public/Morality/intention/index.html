<div class="embed"><h1 id="intention">Intention</h1>
<p>Intention does not negate harm. Related to <h1 id="the-purpose-of-a-system-is-what-it-does">The purpose of a system is what it does</h1>
<p><strong>From Wikipedia:</strong> According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetician" title="Cybernetician">cybernetician</a>, the purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictum" title="Dictum">dictum</a>. It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_judgment" title="Moral judgment">moral judgment</a>, or sheer ignorance of circumstances.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does</a></p>
<p>The logic here is that when we measure a system&rsquo;s effectiveness, we look at its output - what it does - as the ultimate measure of success in its design. Therefore, if a system produces a particular result, its design <strong>must</strong> be extremely effective at achieving that result.</p>
<p>Where things get interesting is when intent doesn&rsquo;t match output. I like this concept because it forces you to work backwards from the output, and if you don&rsquo;t like the purpose that the output creates - in other words, it wasn&rsquo;t your intention - your only choice is to change the result, not just ignore it.</p>
<p>When people are protective of or defend !<a href="/morality/intention/">Intention</a>, it only serves to protect the broken systems and outputs, preventing a productive conversation about meaningful change in the system. I like this quote because it helps illustrate that more clearly.</p>
<p>I think this is a useful framework in management, social justice work, user centered design, and other situations where intent can easily disconnect from output, and allows good intent to be completely possible - and entirely irrelevant to solving the problem at hand. The best intent is the intent to improve.</p>
