<h1 id="slow-media">Slow Media</h1>
<p>A movement to slow the pace of information in modern times. With the advent of social media and the 24 hour news cycle, content is served <em>to</em> the user at increasingly rapid paces. This puts pressure both on information-givers and information-takers to be on top of a rapid firehose of information, often unfiltered.</p>
<h2 id="tools-that-i-think-can-help">Tools that I think can help</h2>
<ul>
<li>RSS feeds, to help filter what types of media show in our feeds</li>
<li>Feedly, which shows a limited number of articles as &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s&rdquo; articles</li>
<li>Social media which does not encourage likes/shares/etc - for example, blogging</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-missing">What is missing?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ways to access older, but more thoroughly researched, content. How do you make it more evergreen? Where can you go to find reliable, well-researched information?

<h2 id="connections-i-make">Connections I make</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>COVID-19:</strong> I wonder about the connection between rapid media/information expectations and waning public support of Dr. Fauci&rsquo;s recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Journalistic errors:</strong> I am interested in if there is a connection between an increase in erroneous reporting and the change in media consumption over time.</li>
<li><strong>Mob mentalities:</strong> I remember the Boston Marathon bombings, and when Reddit was quick to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the mystery of the bomber by rapidly exchaning information - only to find they were completley wrong.</li>
