<h1 id="calm-technology">Calm technology</h1>
<p>A set of principles of interaction design that seeks to reduce user attention, focus, and other principles typically lauded and misused for addictive purposes. Calm technology is a direct response to the idea of &ldquo;delight&rdquo; having gone too far, and hopes to achieve an excellent user experience by creating a supportive environment, where the technology only interrupts or seeks attention as needed. It also hopes to solve the problem with the least technological interference possible.</p>
<p>Calm technology hopes to be aware of and correct for a number of factors outside of technology which could impact a user&rsquo;s experience negatively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Societal norms</li>
<li>Environment</li>
<li>Learned technological ability</li>
<li>The stress induced by rapid change</li>
<li>Existing environmental cues, &ldquo;fading&rdquo; technology into the background instead of bringing it to the front of the mind</li>
</ul>
