<h1 id="packaging">Packaging</h1>
<p>In InDesign, packaging refers to the process of collecting all the assets related to a file, such as images and fonts, and combining them into one folder. It&rsquo;s usually used for sending a file to another designer or to print, because assets usually aren&rsquo;t embedded directly in InDesign files to help improve their performance.
