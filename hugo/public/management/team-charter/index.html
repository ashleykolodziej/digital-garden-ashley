<p>A written shared definition of purpose, which helps guide and motivate a team.</p>
<p>Charters can come in all shapes and sizes, from brief mission statements to lengthier documents that detail how a team operates. Start brief and expand as needed.</p>
<p>As a start, consider:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weâ€™re not here just to make it pretty or easy to use. Through empathy, we ensure meaning and utility. With craft, we elicit understanding and desire. We wrangle the complexity of our o&quot;ering to deliver a clear, coherent, and satisfying experience from start to finish.</p>
