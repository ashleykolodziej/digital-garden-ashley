Draft Uxmatters touch pt 1  Discontinuities in the lines are sensing-precision failures. (The small stylus tip is likely the cause of those, so that issue probably wouldnâ€™t occur with a finger.) The swoops and gaps at the edges are artifacts of the screenâ€™s construction and interference. The waves occur where the calculations between grid lines are a bit off. Therefore, unless youâ€™re creating a drawing tool or a game, pretend, for now, that touchscreens donâ€™t detect pressure.</description>

Notes Jacob Morgan01:20am EST
I define &amp;ldquo;employee experience&amp;rdquo; as an organization creating a place where people want to show up instead of assuming that people need to show up. This shift from &amp;ldquo;need&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;want&amp;rdquo; is the fundamentalÂ change that organizations around the world are starting to experience.</description>

How is the challenge of designing for engagement different for offices vs. remote work?  Where did the collaboration tool/app succeed?
